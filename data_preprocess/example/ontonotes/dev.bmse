the	O

opened	O

only	O

the	O
impact	O

there	O

So	O
,	O
there	O
would	O

The	O
real	O
fatal	O
collision	O
was	O
the	O
second	S-ORDINAL
one	O
from	O
the	O
tailgating	O
truck	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
airbags	O
were	O
already	O
deflated	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
one	O
was	O
extremely	O
large	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
car	O
had	O
been	O
stopped	O
at	O
an	O
angle	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O

on	O
one	O
side	O
would	O
surely	O
have	O
hit	O
the	O

Meanwhile	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
not	O

too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O
for	O
someone	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
common	O
knowledge	O

Then	O
it	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
bad	O
luck	O
of	O
sitting	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
car	O
that	O
was	O
angled	O
out	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
perfectly	O
correct	O
for	O
the	O
front	O
airbag	O
not	O
to	O
open	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
car	O
was	O
not	O
damaged	O
at	O
all	O

None	O
of	O
the	O

received	O
any	O

of	O
a	O

Just	O
imagine	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
rear	O
collision	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
went	O
backward	O
abruptly	O
.	O

Their	O
bodies	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
supported	O
by	O
the	O
seats	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
impact	O
on	O
their	O
necks	O
and	O
heads	O
was	O
tremendous	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
went	O
abruptly	O
backward	O
,	O
any	O
additional	O
misfortune	O
of	O
the	O
front	O
airbag	O
opening	O
for	O
no	O
reason	O
would	O
have	O
eliminated	O
any	O
chance	O
of	O
survival	O

So	O

of	O
all	O
the	O
cars	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
even	O
a	O
Rolls	B-PRODUCT

,	O
the	O
front	O
airbag	O
will	O
not	O
open	O
during	O
a	O
rear	O
collision	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
front	O
airbag	O
opened	O
after	O
being	O
tailgated	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
quality	O
problem	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
extremely	O
dangerous	O
.	O

The	O
safety	O
airbag	O

eruption	O

someone	O

So	O
,	O
infants	O
are	O
strictly	O

That	O

how	O
the	O
whole	O

took	O

The	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
accident	O
investigation	O
division	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
different	O
from	O
this	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
accident	O
,	O
conclusions	O
can	O
be	O
drawn	O
from	O
a	O
single	O
glance	O
at	O
the	O
car	O
wreckage	O
.	O

The	O
car	O
and	O
the	O
car	O
manufacturer	O
have	O
no	O
fault	O
.	O

All	O
of	O
the	O

's	O
passive	O
safety	O
protections	O
had	O
already	O
fully	O
carried	O
out	O
their	O
functions	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
extremely	O
ridiculous	O
and	O
unscientific	O
to	O
blame	O
and	O
suspect	O
the	O
car	O
and	O
the	O
car	O
manufacturer	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
accident	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
speculation	O
about	O
why	O
the	O
front	O
airbags	O
did	O
not	O
open	O
was	O
very	O
amateurish	O
.	O

Only	O
by	O
not	O
opening	O
would	O
it	O
have	O
been	O
correct	O

If	O
they	O

get	O
out	O

leave	O
immediately	O
if	O
you	O
can	O
move	O

Many	O
freeway	O

occur	O
simply	O

people	O
stay	O
inside	O
the	O

sort	O

The	O

could	O
be	O

a	O
rudimentary	O
one	O

which	O
made	O

that	O
led	O
to	O
my	O
first	S-ORDINAL
visit	O
to	O
an	O
American	S-NORP

For	O
some	O
unknown	O

when	O
I	O
was	O
eating	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
tooth	O
suddenly	O
ached	O
during	O
the	O
meal	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O

Unexpected	O
I	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

anything	O

I	O
rushed	O

upon	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

what	O
root	O

meant	O

thought	O
the	O

was	O
quite	O

It	O
was	O
after	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
receive	O
it	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
really	O

For	O

killing	O
the	O

and	O
dealing	O
with	O
the	O
dental	O
crown	O
...	O

I	O
asked	O
the	O
dentist	O
then	O
why	O
my	O
tooth	O
broke	O
.	O

After	O
examining	O
my	O
25	S-CARDINAL
teeth	O
,	O
the	O
dentist	O
told	O
me	O
seriously	O
that	O
the	O
teeth	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
were	O
somewhat	O
"	O
cross	O

"	O
due	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
my	O
teeth	O
,	O
such	O
that	O
the	O
upper	O
and	O
lower	O
right	O
teeth	O
were	O
always	O
against	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

The	O
wrong	O
position	O
had	O
led	O
to	O
uneven	O
abrasions	O

resulting	O
in	O
the	O
broken	O

I	O
asked	O
what	O

with	O

an	O

he	O
may	O
never	O

So	O
whenever	O
you	O
discuss	O
an	O
economic	O
theory	O
with	O
someone	O
,	O
the	O
response	O
of	O
a	O
perfectly	O

would	O
be	O
:	O
My	O
uncle	O
is	O
n't	O

that	O
,	O
so	O
this	O
theory	O
is	O
baloney	O

In	O
other	O
words	O

everybody	O
tends	O
to	O
mistake	O
the	O

for	O

Here	O
,	O
mistaking	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

If	O
Americans	S-NORP
had	O
learned	O
not	O
to	O
mistake	O
the	O
part	O
for	O
the	O

they	O
might	O
not	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
complete	O
mess	O
of	O
the	B-LOC
Middle	M-LOC
East	E-LOC
to	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
extent	O
because	O
they	O
applied	O
their	O
own	O
common	O
sense	O
to	O
understanding	O
the	B-LOC
Middle	M-LOC
East	E-LOC
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
completely	O
different	O
place	O
from	O
the	B-GPE
United	M-GPE
States	E-GPE
.	O

On	O
this	O
issue	O
,	O
China	S-GPE
does	O
not	O
have	O
much	O
basis	O
for	O
being	O
self	O
-	O
congratulatory	O
;	O
China	S-GPE
's	O
rapid	O
rise	O
has	O
even	O
caused	O
some	O
people	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
misconception	O
-	O
that	O
whatever	O
China	S-GPE
does	O
is	O
right	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
in	O
fact	O
a	O
manifestation	O
of	O
narrow	O
-	O
mindedness	O
.	O

Therefore	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
extremely	O
important	O
to	O
recognize	O
that	O
one	O
's	O
own	O
knowledge	O
has	O
limitations	O
.	O

We	O
need	O
to	O
maintain	O
a	O
sufficiently	O
open	O
attitude	O
toward	O
things	O
that	O
do	O
n't	O
correspond	O
to	O
our	O
common	O
sense	O

So	O
just	O
because	O
every	O
time	O
your	O
uncle	O
goes	O
to	O
the	O
supermarket	O
he	O
buys	O
hog	O
head	O
meat	O
does	O
n't	O
mean	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
immediately	O
assume	O
that	O
any	O
theory	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
predict	O
people	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
supermarket	O
will	O
buy	O
hog	O
head	O
meat	O
is	O
wrong	O
.	O

When	O
you	O
feel	O
other	O
people	O
are	O
talking	O
baloney	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
other	O
people	O

does	O
not	O
correspond	O
to	O
your	O
"	O
common	O
sense	O

"	O
you	O
should	O
at	O

the	O
way	O
he	O

then	O
it	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O

that	O
's	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
.	O

Up	O
upscale	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
.	O

So	O
think	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O
I	O
'll	O
let	O
you	O
think	O
about	O
that	O

and	O
you	O
can	O
write	O
me	O
a	O
note	O
or	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
call	O
.	O

Because	O
I	O
know	O
some	O
people	O
really	O
hate	O
weddings	O
.	O

But	O
you	O
're	O
afraid	O
to	O
say	O
no	O
,	O

or	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

But	O

Like	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
each	O
other	O

And	O
then	O
I	O
'll	O
go	O
Monday	S-DATE
--	O
down	O
to	O
Bonn	S-GPE
,	O
or	O
wherever	O
those	O
relatives	O

because	O
I	O
have	O
n't	O
seen	O
my	O
uncle	O
in	O
like	B-DATE
three	M-DATE
or	M-DATE
four	M-DATE
years	E-DATE
,	O
and	O
he	O
's	O
just	O
turning	O
eighty	S-DATE
and	O
I	O
like	O
them	O
a	O
lot	O

uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
Bad	B-GPE
Muenstereifel	E-GPE
?	O

yeah	O
,	O

I	O
'll	O

guess	O

summer	S-DATE

so	O
he	O
'll	O
be	O
in	O
Bad	B-GPE
Munstereifel	E-GPE

Bonn	S-GPE
now	O
.	O

They	O
live	O
in	O
--	O
%um	O
,	O
Bad	B-GPE
Neuena	E-GPE
.	O
Which	O
is	O
I	O
guess	O

Bad	B-GPE
Neuena	E-GPE
ja	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O

just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
down	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
'll	O
be	O
in	O
Munstereifel	S-GPE
.	O

And	O
then	O
my	O
cousin	O
,	O
she	O
still	O
does	O
live	O
in	O
Bonn	S-GPE

so	O
I	O
'll	O
get	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
I	O
'll	O
zip	O
off	O
to	O
Berlin	S-GPE
Right	O
.	O
mhm	O
mhm	O
go	O
to	O
this	O
wedding	O
and	O
see	O
my	O
favorite	O
cousin	O
.	O

Do	O
n't	O
tell	O
the	O
other	O
cousins	O
.	O

uh-huh	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

Because	O
you	O
see	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
visit	O
you	O
because	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
spend	O
time	O
visiting	O
these	O
other	O
relatives	O
in	O
Bonn	S-GPE
.	O

you	O
're	O
so	O
diplomatic	O
about	O
all	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
you	O
know	O

Well	O
I	O
mean	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
visiting	O
you	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
hard	O
not	O
to	O
visit	O
them	O
.	O

but	O
n-	O

But	O
the	O
year	O
before	O
I	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
n't	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
tell	O
on	O
you	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
tell	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
year	O
before	O
I	O
did	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
's	O
because	O
of	O
we	O
just	O
stopped	O
on	O
the	O
train	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
two	B-TIME
hours	E-TIME
.	O

And	O
we	O
had	O
our	O
wild	O
lunch	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
on	O
again	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

That	O
's	O

We	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
commiserated	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

That	O
sounds	O
like	O
you	O
have	O
you	O
know	O
its	O
positive	O
end	O
result	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
good	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
change	O
,	O

that	O
's	O
for	O
sure	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
change	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
work	O
,	O
obviously	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O

I	O
,	O

%eh	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
really	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
work	O
.	O

I	O
always	O
have	O
this	O
feeling	O
I	O
'm	O
just	O
so	O
terribly	O
slow	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
this	O
feeling	O
I	O
should	O
always	O
be	O
doing	O
these	O
things	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
I	O
get	O
them	O
done	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
so	O
what	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
slow	O
?	O

You	O
know	O
,	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
.	O

yeah	O

but	O
I	O
always	O
keep	O
%eh	O
that	O
I	O
'm	O
spending	O
too	O
much	O
time	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O
other	O
things	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

I	O
just	O
had	O
this	O
talk	O
about	O
somebody	O
who	O
was	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
confirming	O
,	O
you	O
know	O

and	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
'm	O
too	O
self	O
critical	O
.	O

So	O
.	O
It	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
.	O

Because	O
I	O
was	O
complaining	O
to	O
them	O
about	O
my	O
mother	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
this	O
theory	O
that	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
what	O
people	O
do	O
is	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

%huh	O
.	O

Because	O
this	O
woman	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
that	O
people	O
react	O
to	O
you	O
as	O
a	O
reflection	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

And	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
mentioned	O
about	O
my	O
mother	O
bugging	O
me	O
was	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
every	O
time	O
I	O
see	O
her	O
or	O
we	O
even	O
talk	O
,	O
she	O
has	O
to	O
comment	O
about	O
my	O
clothes	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
I	O
'm	O
wearing	O
.	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
talking	O
to	O
this	O
woman	O
because	O
she	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
such	O
a	O
good	O
relationship	O
with	O
her	O
mother	O
.	O

Like	O
her	O
mother	O
treated	O
her	O
like	O
a	O
human	O
being	O
and	O
not	O
a	O
kid	O
.	O

%hm	O
yeah	O

and	O
so	O
she	O
said	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
she	O
's	O
just	O
a	O
reflection	O
.	O

You	O
know	O
your	O
mother	O
's	O
being	O
critical	O
you	O
know	O
.	O

Be	O
you	O
see	O
that	O
because	O
you	O
're	O
critical	O
to	O
yourself	O
too	O
much	O

Or	O
you	O
're	O
filtering	O
the	O
information	O
you	O
get	O
from	O
your	O
mother	O

yeah	O

but	O
this	O
is	O
ridiculous	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
%uh	O
she	O
's	O
never	O
let	O
up	O
on	O
that	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
crazy	O
.	O
You	O
know	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
I	O
mean	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
no	O
not	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
on	O
the	O
phone	O
I	O
bugged	O
her	O
about	O
something	O
else	O
that	O
I	O
been	O

how	O
it	O
goes	O

hopefully	O

I	O
mean	O
they	O
promise	O
me	O
you	O
know	O
everybody	O
that	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
help	O
me	O
and	O
that	O
whatever	O
I	O
say	O

But	O
you	O
know	O
everybody	O
gives	O
you	O
%uh	O
these	O
%uh	O
pro-	O

yeah	O

so	O
you	O
've	O
already	O
started	O

Well	O
I	O
've	O
started	O
working	O
with	O
Du	O

like	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
cook	O
anymore	O

I	O
have	O
n't	O
worked	O
in	O
the	O
kitchen	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
already	O

I	O
've	O
been	O
just	O
doing	O
with	O
him	O
learning	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
orders	O
and	O
meeting	O
all	O
the	O
%um	O
sales	O
people	O

and	O
%um	O
I	O
've	O
learned	O
how	O
to	O
work	O
the	O
computer	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
bigges-	O

I	O
said	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
turn	O
it	O
on	O
even	O

really	O

So	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
it	O
yet	O
by	O
myself	O

but	O
he	O
's	O
showing	O
me	O
teaching	O
me	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
like	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
week	O
he	O
'll	O
be	O
there	O
a	B-DATE
few	M-DATE
days	E-DATE
with	O
me	O

and	O
then	O
anoth-	O

he	O
%um	O

Maybe	O
here	O
and	O
there	O

but	O
he	O
's	O
really	O
basically	O

What	O
is	O
he	O
going	O
to	O
do	O

He	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
teacher	O
for	O
%um	O
High	O
school	O
computers	O

oh	O
okay	O

yeah	O

so	O
he	O
's	O
only	O
teaching	O
three	B-DATE
days	E-DATE
a	O
week	O

so	O
he	O
always	O
says	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
days	O
if	O
I	O
need	O
him	O
he	O
'll	O
come	O
in	O

the	O
truth	O
is	O
he	O
's	O
been	O
teaching	O
and	O
very	O
patient	O
and	O
very	O
good	O

and	O
he	O
also	O
is	O
great	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
written	O
down	O
everything	O

I	O
'm	O
sure	O
he	O
's	O
thrilled	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
there	O

Well	O
I	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
truth	O
%uh	O

I	O
mean	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
worked	O
with	O
him	O
one	O
to	O
one	O
He	O
does	O
do	O
everything	O
with	O
his	O
heart	O

I	O
mean	O
he	O
has	O
a	O
different	O
head	O
than	O
everybody	O
else	O

like	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wants	O
everything	O
to	O
be	O
nice	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
good	O
and	O

but	O
he	O
's	O
very	O
separate	O

and	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
like	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
other	O
people	O
's	O
%um	O
ideas	O

but	O
%um	O
I	O
'm	O
sure	O
financially	O
he	O
was	O
probably	O
great	O
for	O
the	O
kibbutz	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
cheap	O

yeah	O

because	O
he	O
's	O
also	O

I	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O

I	O
worked	O
with	O
him	O
this	O
whole	O
week	O

he	O
does	O
n't	O
eat	O
a	O
thing	O
ever	O

like	O
all	O
morning	O
long	O

so	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
eat	O

he	O
does	O
n't	O
drink	O
coffee	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
see	O
him	O
drink	O
anything	O
water	O
or	O
anything	O
else	O

one	O
day	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
better	O
drink	O
something	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
headache	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
hot	O

but	O
I	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
eat	O
anything	O

and	O
then	O
for	O
lunch	O
when	O
we	O
finally	O
went	O
to	O
go	O
get	O
something	O
to	O
eat	O
Also	O
he	O
eats	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
What	O
we	O
would	O
eat	O
maybe	O
half	O
for	O
a	O
meal	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
it	O

so	O
I	O
can	O
understand	O
now	O
why	O
he	O
thinks	O
that	O
because	O
he	O
does	O
n't	O
have	O
big	O
eyes	O
you	O
know	O

right	O

that	O
's	O
so	O
funny	O

but	O
anyway	O

no	O

so	O
he	O
had	O
agreed	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
a	B-DATE
year	E-DATE

and	O
his	O
year	O
is	O
over	O

I	O

are	O
you	O
excited	O
at	O
all	O
about	O
it	O

or	O

well	O
I	O
'll	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
truth	O

until	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
decision	O
I	O
was	O
scared	O
and	O
also	O
utz	O

I	O
miss	O
the	O
cooking	O
part	O

You	O
miss	O
it	O

that	O
's	O
funny	O

I	O

make	O
sure	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
way	O

Matty	S-PERSON
said	O
to	O
me	O
Ellen	S-PERSON

tha-	O

and	O
they	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O
cooking	O

different	O

Well	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
even	O
**ruthie**	O
says	O
you	O
know	O

everyone	O
thinks	O
that	O
the	O
economie	O

a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
very	O
important	O
of	O
running	O
the	O
kitchen	O

and	O
we	O
'll	O

%uh	O
right	O
now	O
Ramon	S-PERSON
%uh	O

you	O
know	O
Cocoa	S-PERSON
she	O
got	O
married	O

She	O
married	O
that	O

not	O
the	O
Israeli	S-NORP

820.26_822.65_B:	O

%um	O

already	O
around	O
then	O

but	O

were	O
still	O
friends	O

and	O
this	O
guy	O
was	O
a	O
here	O
or	O
something	O
drawer	O

I	O
think	O
his	O
family	O

Romanian	S-NORP
or	O
something	O

anyway	O

yeah	O

it	O
was	O
very	O
fast	O

oh	O
my	O

why	O
did	O
they	O
allow	O
that	O

Well	O
I	O
guess	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
a	O
choice	O

but	O
the	O
worst	O
thing	O
was	O
originally	O
when	O
she	O
came	O
to	O
her	O
parents	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
married	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
married	O
in	O
October	S-DATE

but	O
she	O
got	O
engaged	O
like	O
before	O
Pesach	S-EVENT

so	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
married	O
in	O
October	S-DATE

so	O
they	O
were	O
n't	O
so	O
thrilled	O

but	O
at	O
least	O
okay	O
it	O
's	O
%uh	O

and	O
then	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
and	O
said	O
no	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
married	O

they	O
got	O
married	O
the	O
I	O
think	O
oh	O
my	O
g-	O
second	B-DATE
week	M-DATE

on	O
the	O
grass	O
outside	O
the	O

and	O
it	O

beautiful	O

we	O

right	O

and	O
we	O

serving	O
everything	O
we	O

uh-huh	O

anymore	O
because	O

's	O
a	O
professor	O
of	O

or	O
other	O
in	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O

China	S-GPE
or	O
somewhere	O

Singapore	S-GPE

I	O
do	O
n't	O

where	O

anyway	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
really	O
weird	O

like	O
when	O
she	O
got	O
engaged	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
hard	O
for	O
Rachel	S-PERSON
because	O
he	O
's	O
not	O
religious	O
and	O
everyone	O
was	O
really	O
upset	O

gosh	O
you	O
would	O
think	O
at	O

in	O
Israel	S-GPE
you	O
would	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
want	O

No	O

but	O
not	O

He	O

different	O
boyfriends	O
during	O
her	O

anyway	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
long	O

her	O
wedding	O
also	O

but	O
hers	O
we	O
did	O
like	O
%um	O
a	O
buffet	O

so	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
nervous	O
about	O
that	O
because	O
when	O
did	O
we	O
ever	O
do	O
a	O
buffet	O

so	O
we	O
rented	O
the	O
tables	O
and	O
chairs	O
again	O

and	O
we	O
rented	O
all	O
the	O
beautiful	O
dishes	O

yeah	O

But	O
we	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
buffet	O

we	O
bought	O
like	O
these	O
really	O
neat	O

you	O
know	O
like	O
they	O
're	O

Well	O
we	O
saved	O
them	O

you	O
can	O
wash	O
them	O

they	O
're	O
made	O
out	O
of	O
plastic	O

but	O
they	O
look	O
like	O
silver	O
trays	O

uh-huh	O

yeah	O

So	O
we	O
bought	O
all	O
different	O
shapes	O
and	O
sizes	O

and	O
we	O
put	O
out	O
the	O
salads	O
and	O
the	O
meats	O
and	O
all	O
different	O
kinds	O
that	O

we	O
had	O
%um	O
little	O
cocktail	O
hot	O
dogs	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
chicken	O
legs	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
schnitzels	O

oh	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
beautiful	O
basket	O
with	O
breads	O
you	O
know	O
everything	O
falling	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
table	O

you	O

only	O
thing	O

you	O
guys	O
must	O
feel	O
so	O
old	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
married	O
children	O
already	O

yeah	O

we	O
do	O
feel	O
old	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
beautiful	O

Ramona	S-PERSON
's	O
was	O
nicer	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
band	O
and	O
everybody	O
was	O
that	O

you	O
know	O
like	O
usually	O
in	O
a	O
wedding	O
there	O
's	O
no	O
room	O
to	O

but	O
the	O
whole	O

for	O
dancing	O

and	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
girls	O
a	O
circle	O
of	O
her	O

room	O
the	O

that	O
you	O

her	O
be	O
happy	O
for	O
her	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
why	O

that	O
was	O
ridiculous	O
because	O
everyone	O
was	O
just	O
as	O
happy	O

but	O
her	O
band	O
they	O
got	O
stuck	O
somewhere	O

and	O
their	O
%um	O

something	O
with	O
the	O
electric	O
equipment	O

it	O
did	O
n't	O
come	O

so	O
we	O
had	O

and	O
ours	O

terrible	O

%mm	O
oy	O

they	O

just	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
dance	O

and	O
she	O
was	O

Rachel	S-PERSON
why	O
did	O
you	O
even	O
bother	O
paying	O
them	O

Well	O
that	O
's	O
true	O

getting	O
this	O
really	O
great	O

and	O
even	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
've	O
known	O
they	O
were	O
stuck	O
so	O
call	O
the	O

something	O
we	O
'd	O
want	O

it	O
's	O
not	O

no	O
no	O
no	O

I	O

six	S-CARDINAL
or	O
seven	B-DATE

**maturer**	O

you	O

in	O
the	B-DATE

and	O
I	O
could	O

there	O
's	O
a	O

they	O
tell	O
us	O
I	O
think	O
Europe	S-GPE

it	O
's	O
%uh	O

but	O
we	O

so	O
everything	O
you	O
kn-	O

I	O
tell	O
you	O
it	O
breaks	O
my	O
heart	O
when	O
I	O

following	O
that	O

they	O
think	O
everything	O
is	O
so	O

if	O
there	O
's	O
some	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

I	O
know	O

they	O
take	O
the	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
bad	O
all	O
the	O

and	O
that	O
's	O
t-	O

yeah	O

oh	O
it	O
's	O
pitiful	O

that	O
makes	O
me	O
very	O
very	O
sad	O

you	O

oh	O
it	O
's	O
%eh	O

very	O
sad	O

and	O
even	O
the	O
Russians	S-NORP
they	O
come	O
over	O

and	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
the	O

he	O
was	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O

he	O
three	B-DATE

but	O
this	O
is	O
parttime	O

but	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
involving	O

it	O
's	O
very	O
exciting	O

oh	O
that	O
's	O
nice	O

and	O
I	O

that	O
the	O

it	O
's	O
about	O

I	O
said	O
oh	O

that	O
you	O

you	O
know	O

and	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
underlying	O
it	O
they	O
really	O

that	O
because	O
if	O
it	O
's	O
so	O
wonderful	O

yeah	O

they	O
know	O
everyone	O
dies	O

underneath	O
they	O
feel	O
maybe	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
die	O
until	O
you	O
're	O
very	O
very	O

in	O
the	B-GPE
United	M-GPE

because	O
it	O
's	O
so	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O

and	O
you	O

they	O
were	O
slaves	O

they	O
could	O
n't	O
go	O
anywhere	O
do	O
anything	O

yeah	O

they	O
had	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
small	O
you	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O

What	O
we	O

when	O
we	O

what	O
we	O

this	O

is	O
that	O
he	O

the	O
most	O

Larry	S-PERSON

uh	O
any	O

been	O
cleaned	O

Well	O
it	O
's	O
very	O
difficult	O
Dan	S-PERSON

Uh	O
obviously	O
as	O
we	O
keep	O
saying	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
a	O

therefore	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
a	O
cause	O
or	O
a	O
manner	O

we	O
do	O
have	O
some	O

Unfortunately	O
examination	O

People	O
brought	O

lay	O

the	O

told	O

did	O
not	O

Peter	O
wondered	O
what	O
this	O
vision	O
meant	O

The	O
men	O
Cornelius	O
sent	O
had	O
found	O
Simon	O

They	O
were	O

They	O
asked	O

``	O

While	O
Peter	O
was	O
still	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
vision	O

the	O
Spirit	O
said	O
to	O

``	O

Peter	O

There	O

we	O

I	O
am	O

that	O
when	O

it	O
is	O
an	O

I	O

.	O

And	O
so	O
,	O
brothers	O
and	O
sisters	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
completely	O
free	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
do	O
this	O
without	O
fear	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
blood	O
sacrifice	O
of	O
Jesus	O
.	O

We	O
enter	O
through	O
a	O
new	O
way	O
that	O
Jesus	O
opened	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
living	O
way	O
that	O
leads	O
through	O
the	O
curtain	O
--	O
Christ	O
's	O
body	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
priest	O
who	O
rules	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
God	O
.	O

Sprinkled	O
with	O
the	O
blood	O
of	O
Christ	O
,	O
our	O
hearts	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
free	O
from	O
a	O
guilty	O
conscience	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
bodies	O
have	O
been	O
washed	O
with	O
pure	O
water	O
.	O

So	O
come	O
near	O
to	O
God	O
with	O
a	O
sincere	O
heart	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
confidence	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
faith	O
in	O
Christ	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
hold	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
hope	O
we	O
have	O
,	O
never	O
hesitating	O
to	O
tell	O
people	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
can	O
trust	O
God	O
to	O
do	O
what	O
he	O
promised	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
think	O
about	O
each	O
other	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
can	O
encourage	O
each	O
other	O
to	O
show	O
love	O
and	O
do	O
good	O
works	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
not	O
quit	O
meeting	O
together	O
,	O
as	O
some	O
are	O
doing	O
.	O

No	O
,	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
encouraging	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

This	O
becomes	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
important	O
as	O
you	O
see	O
the	O
Day	O
getting	O
closer	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
decide	O
to	O
continue	O
sinning	O
after	O
we	O
have	O
learned	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
then	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
other	O
sacrifice	O
that	O
will	O
take	O
away	O
sins	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
continue	O
sinning	O
,	O
all	O
that	O
is	O
left	O
for	O
us	O
is	O
a	O
fearful	O
time	O
of	O
waiting	O
for	O
the	O
judgment	O
and	O
the	O
angry	O
fire	O
that	O
will	O
destroy	O
those	O
who	O
live	O
against	O
God	O
.	O

Whoever	O
refused	O
to	O
obey	O
the	O
Law	O
of	O
Moses	O
was	O
found	O
guilty	O
from	O
the	O
testimony	O
given	O
by	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
witnesses	O
.	O

Such	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
forgiven	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
killed	O
.	O

So	O
think	O
how	O
much	O
more	O
punishment	O
people	O
deserve	O
who	O
show	O
their	O
hate	O
for	O
the	O
Son	O
of	O
God	O
--	O
people	O
who	O
show	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
respect	O
for	O
the	O
blood	O
sacrifice	O
that	O
began	O
the	O
new	O
agreement	O
and	O
once	O
made	O
them	O
holy	O
or	O
who	O
insult	O
the	O
Spirit	O
of	O
God	O
's	O
grace	O
.	O

We	O
know	O
that	O
God	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
will	O
punish	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
wrongs	O
they	O
do	O
;	O
I	O
will	O
repay	O
them	O
.	O
''	O

And	O
he	O
also	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
The	O
Lord	O
will	O
judge	O
his	O
people	O
.	O
''	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
terrible	O
thing	O
to	O
face	O
punishment	O
from	O
the	O
living	O
God	O
.	O

Remember	O
the	O
days	O
when	O
you	O
first	O
learned	O
the	O
truth	O
.	O

You	O
had	O
a	O
hard	O
struggle	O
with	O
much	O
suffering	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
continued	O
strong	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
people	O
said	O
hateful	O
things	O
to	O
you	O
and	O
mistreated	O
you	O
in	O
public	O
.	O

And	O
sometimes	O
you	O
helped	O
others	O
who	O
were	O
being	O
treated	O
that	O
same	O
way	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
you	O
helped	O
them	O
in	O
prison	O
and	O
shared	O
in	O
their	O
suffering	O
.	O

And	O
you	O
were	O
still	O
happy	O
when	O
everything	O
you	O
owned	O
was	O
taken	O
away	O
from	O
you	O
.	O

You	O
continued	O
to	O
be	O
happy	O
,	O
because	O
you	O
knew	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
something	O
much	O
better	O
--	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
continue	O
forever	O
.	O

So	O
do	O
n't	O
lose	O
the	O
courage	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
.	O

Your	O
courage	O
will	O
be	O
rewarded	O
richly	O
.	O

You	O
must	O
be	O
patient	O
.	O

After	O
you	O
have	O
done	O
what	O
God	O
wants	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
get	O
what	O
he	O
promised	O
you	O

He	O
says	O

Then	O
I	O
saw	O
another	O

coming	O
down	O
from	O

The	O
angel	O
was	O
dressed	O

He	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

The	O
Ammonites	O
saw	O
that	O

There	O
were	O
20,000	O

The	O
Ammonites	O
also	O
hired	O
the	O
king	O

with	O
1000	O
men	O

12,000	O

David	O
heard	O
about	O

the	O

The	O
Ammonites	O
came	O
out	O

got	O
ready	O
for	O
the	O
battle	O

They	O
stood	O
at	O
the	O

from	O
Zobah	O

Rehob	O

the	O
men	O
from	O
Tob	O

did	O
not	O
stand	O
together	O

the	O

that	O
there	O

he	O
chose	O

up	O

Joab	O

his	O

attacked	O
the	O

The	O
Arameans	O
ran	O
away	O
from	O

his	O

The	O
Ammonites	O
saw	O
that	O

they	O
ran	O
away	O

went	O

from	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

went	O
back	O

that	O

defeated	O
them	O

they	O
came	O
together	O
into	O
one	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

These	O

came	O
to	O

Their	O

the	O

When	O
David	O

about	O

gathered	O
all	O

crossed	O
over	O
the	O

went	O
to	O
Helam	O

There	O
the	O

prepared	O

attacked	O

David	O
defeated	O
them	O

and	O
they	O
ran	O
from	O
the	O

David	O
killed	O
700	O

40,000	O

as	O

as	O
Shobach	O

the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Aramean	O
army	O

The	O
kings	O
who	O
served	O
Hadadezer	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O
Israelites	O
had	O
defeated	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
made	O
peace	O
with	O
the	O
Israelites	O
and	O
became	O

servants	O

The	O
Arameans	O
were	O
afraid	O

again	O

At	O
that	O
place	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
man	O

Sheba	O
was	O
a	O
worthless	O

from	O
the	O
tribe	O

Benjamin	O

He	O
blew	O
a	O

all	O
the	O

left	O
David	O

followed	O

the	O

with	O
their	O

all	O
the	O
way	O
from	O
the	O
Jordan	O

David	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
his	O

ten	O

put	O

he	O
put	O

They	O
stayed	O
in	O
this	O
house	O

David	O
took	O
care	O

the	O

gave	O
them	O
food	O

he	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
sexual	O

with	O
them	O

They	O
lived	O
like	O
widows	O

The	O
king	O
told	O

Amasa	O
called	O

he	O
took	O
longer	O

that	O

Now	O
the	O
Lord	O
has	O
done	O
what	O
he	O

he	O
would	O

So	O
Jehu	O
killed	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
Ahab	O
's	O
family	O
living	O
in	O
Jezreel	O

He	O
killed	O
all	O
the	O
important	O
men	O

close	O

and	O
priests	O

None	O
of	O
Ahab	O
's	O
people	O
were	O
left	O
alive	O

Jehu	O
left	O
Jezreel	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
Samaria	O

On	O
the	O
way	O
he	O
stopped	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
called	O
Shepherd	O

Camp	O

There	O
he	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
relatives	O
of	O
King	O
Ahaziah	O
of	O
Judah	O

Jehu	O
asked	O
,	O
``	O

They	O
answered	O

``	O

the	O

and	O
the	O

''	O

Then	O
Jehu	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
Take	O
them	O
alive	O

''	O

Jehu	O
's	O
men	O
captured	O
Ahaziah	O
's	O
relatives	O
alive	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
42	O
of	O
them	O

Jehu	O
killed	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
well	O
near	O
Beth	O
Eked	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
leave	O
anyone	O
alive	O

After	O
Jehu	O
left	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
met	O
Jehonadab	O
son	O
of	O
Recab	O
.	O

Jehonadab	O
was	O
on	O
his	O
way	O
to	O
meet	O
Jehu	O

Jehu	O
greeted	O
Jehonadab	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
``	O

Jehonadab	O
answered	O

``	O
Yes	O

I	O

Jehu	O

,	O
``	O
If	O
you	O

me	O
your	O

Then	O
Jehu	O
reached	O
out	O
and	O
pulled	O
Jehonadab	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
chariot	O

Jehu	O
said	O

``	O

So	O
Jehonadab	O
rode	O
in	O
Jehu	O
's	O
chariot	O

Jehu	O
came	O
to	O
Samaria	O

killed	O
all	O
Ahab	O

were	O
still	O
alive	O

He	O
killed	O
them	O
all	O

He	O
did	O
what	O
the	O
Lord	O
had	O
told	O
Elijah	O

Then	O
Jehu	O
gathered	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
together	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
``	O
Ahab	O
served	O

Now	O
call	O
together	O
all	O

call	O

But	O
Jehu	O
was	O
tricking	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
wanted	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
worshipers	O
of	O
Baal	O

Jehu	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
Prepare	O

holy	O

So	O
the	O
priests	O
announced	O
the	O
meeting	O

Then	O
Jehu	O
sent	O
a	O
message	O
through	O
all	O
the	O
land	O
of	O
Israel	O

All	O
the	O
worshipers	O
of	O
Baal	O
came	O

Not	O
one	O
stayed	O
home	O

The	O
Baal	O
worshipers	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O

The	O
temple	O
was	O
filled	O
with	O
people	O

Jehu	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
kept	O
the	O
robes	O

``	O
Bring	O
out	O
the	O
robes	O

So	O
that	O
man	O
brought	O
out	O
the	O
robes	O
for	O
the	O
Baal	O
worshipers	O
.	O

Then	O
Jehu	O
and	O
Jehonadab	O
son	O
of	O
Recab	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O

Jehu	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
worshipers	O
of	O
Baal	O

``	O

The	O
worshipers	O
of	O
Baal	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O
to	O
offer	O
sacrifices	O
and	O
burnt	O
offerings	O
.	O

But	O
outside	O
,	O
Jehu	O
had	O
80	O
men	O
waiting	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
``	O
Do	O
n't	O

If	O
any	O

,	O
that	O
man	O

''	O

Quickly	O
after	O
Jehu	O
had	O
finished	O
offering	O
the	O
burnt	O
offering	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
guards	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
captains	O
,	O
``	O
Go	O
in	O

Do	O

anyone	O

out	O

So	O
the	O
captains	O
used	O
thin	O
swords	O
and	O
killed	O
the	O
worshipers	O
of	O
Baal	O
.	O

They	O
threw	O
the	O
bodies	O
of	O
the	O
worshipers	O
of	O
Baal	O
out	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
guards	O
and	O
the	O
captains	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
inner	O
room	O
of	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O
.	O

They	O
brought	O
out	O
the	O
memorial	O
stones	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O
and	O
burned	O
that	O
temple	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
smashed	O
the	O
memorial	O
stones	O
of	O
Baal	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
smashed	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O

They	O
made	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
Baal	O
into	O
a	O
public	O
toilet	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
still	O
used	O
today	O

So	O
Jehu	O
destroyed	O
Baal	O
worship	O
in	O
Israel	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
completely	O
turn	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
sins	O
of	O
Jeroboam	O
son	O
of	O
Nebat	O
that	O
caused	O
Israel	O
to	O
sin	O

Jehu	O
did	O
not	O
destroy	O
the	O
golden	O
calves	O
in	O
Bethel	O
and	O
in	O
Dan	O

The	O
Lord	O
said	O
to	O
Jehu	O

``	O

But	O
Jehu	O
was	O
not	O

to	O
follow	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
the	O
Lord	O
with	O
all	O

Jehu	O

stop	O
committing	O
the	O
sins	O
of	O
Jeroboam	O
that	O
caused	O
Israel	O
to	O
sin	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
the	O

began	O
to	O
cut	O
away	O
sections	O
of	O
Israel	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
to	O
other	O
nations	O

King	O
Hazael	O
of	O

defeated	O
the	O

Jehu	O

over	O

for	O
28	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
Hezekiah	O
became	O
sick	O
and	O
almost	O
died	O

The	O
prophet	O
Isaiah	O
son	O
of	O

went	O
to	O

Hezekiah	O
turned	O
his	O

my	O

Then	O
I	O
was	O

lots	O

and	O
in	O

you	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O
hack	O

up	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
already	O

it	O

What	O
did	O
you	O
say	O
?	O

said	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
hack	O
him	O

have	O
to	O

,	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
or	O
less	O

this	O
child	O

But	O
,	O
those	O
adults	O
standing	O
around	O
reasoned	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
said	O
look	O
,	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
this	O

If	O
you	O
do	O
this	O

you	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
ran	O

took	O
a	O

at	O
the	O

I	O
just	O
let	O
the	O

reason	O
with	O
me	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

from	O
your	O

It	O

had	O
a	O

Mm	O

,	O
the	O
reason	O
I	O
like	O
it	O
is	O
because	O

it	O
brings	O
up	O
lots	O

of	O

In	O

the	O

you	O
went	O
from	O

Shanghai	S-GPE
.	O

Mm	O
,	O
your	O
living	O

changed	O
,	O
but	O
perhaps	O
that	O
mischievousness	O
had	O
n't	O
completely	O

Mm	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
puts	O
it	O

looking	O

it	O
now	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
pretty	O

I	O
went	O

how	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
school	O
kid	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
Um	O
,	O
that	O
girl	O
,	O
who	O
ran	O
the	O

and	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
our	O

I	O

I	O
always	O

um	O
,	O
she	O
can	O

give	O
you	O
more	O

And	O
then	O
the	O
most	O

way	O
was	O
um	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
see	O
a	O
movie	O
together	O
.	O

Mm	O

It	O
was	O
,	O

So	O
already	O
you	O
could	O
--	O
Go	O
see	O
a	O
movie	O
;	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O

That	O
was	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
it	O
.	O

You	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
see	O
the	O
movie	O
,	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
worry	O
about	O
holding	O
hands	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
great	O
,	O
--	O

So	O
you	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
movies	O
with	O
this	O
girl	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

Do	O
you	O
still	O
remember	O
what	O
movies	O
you	O
saw	O
?	O

The	B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower	M-WORK_OF_ART
Girl	M-WORK_OF_ART

I	O
still	O
remember	O
that	O
now	O
.	O

Mm	O
.	O

She	O
cried	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
.	O

So	O
seeing	O
The	B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower	M-WORK_OF_ART
Girl	E-WORK_OF_ART
was	O
the	O
equivalent	O
of	O
seeing	O
Titanic	S-WORK_OF_ART
now	O
.	O

Oh	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
a	O

,	O
a	O

,	O
yes	O
,	O
all	O
was	O

Yes	O
,	O
crying	O
her	O
eyes	O
out	O
,	O
a	O
big	O

that	O

At	O
the	O
time	O
I	O

I	O
would	O
n't	O
cry	O

But	O
the	O
people	O
all	O
around	O
were	O
crying	O

and	O
I	O
thought	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
cry	O
it	O
would	O
look	O
bad	O
.	O

So	O
then	O
you	O
cried	O
.	O

So	O
then	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
let	O
my	O
emotions	O
go	O
.	O

Um	O
,	O
how	O
was	O
the	O
girl	O
,	O
was	O
she	O
very	O

How	O
was	O

At	O
that	O

we	O

if	O
two	S-CARDINAL
people	O
gave	O
each	O

the	O

and	O
felt	O
it	O
was	O
right	O

then	O
,	O

Gave	O
each	O
other	O
the	O
eye	O
,	O
while	O
you	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
class	O
you	O
gave	O
each	O

the	O

,	O
so	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
in	O

you	O

I	O
remember	O

we	O

I	O
threw	O
it	O
at	O
someone	O
else	O
but	O
missed	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
hit	O
her	O

The	O
result	O
was	O
that	O
she	O
turned	O
her	O

to	O
look	O

And	O
she	O
looked	O
at	O
you	O
angrily	O

I	O
thought	O
,	O
uh-oh	O
,	O
the	O
expression	O
in	O
her	O

was	O

she	O

Gao	B-PERSON
Xingjian	E-PERSON
is	O
quite	O
an	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
great	O
difference	O
about	O

is	O
that	O
he	O
actually	O
received	O
a	O

He	O
was	O
educated	O
in	O
French	S-LANGUAGE

so	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
knowledge	O
of	O
French	S-NORP
literature	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
much	O
French	S-NORP

that	O
has	O
influenced	O
his	O

,	O
only	O
free	O

,	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
that	O
conservative	O
Chinese	S-NORP
critics	O
would	O
accuse	O
him	O
of	O
blind	O
worship	O
of	O
Western	S-NORP

Sartre	S-PERSON
is	O
a	O
big	O
man	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Xingjian	S-PERSON

is	O
n't	O
he	O
?	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
so	O
that	O
Sartre	S-PERSON
has	O
been	O
a	O
quite	O
a	O
big	O
influence	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
other	O
influences	O
would	O
be	O
Samuel	B-PERSON
Beckett	E-PERSON
,	O
the	O
Irish	S-LANGUAGE
and	O
French	S-LANGUAGE

,	O
Unesco	S-PERSON

These	O
are	O
models	O
and	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
writers	O
are	O

of	M-DATE

.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
very	O
interesting	O
because	O
Mr.	O
Gao	S-PERSON
left	O
China	S-GPE
before	O
Tianenmen	S-EVENT
.	O

He	O
wrote	O
a	O
play	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
about	O
the	O
events	O
there	O
.	O

Would	O
you	O
say	O
that	O
his	O
influences	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
French	S-NORP
literary	O
then	O
they	O
were	O
his	O
own	O
immediate	O
life	O
experience	O
?	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
both	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
first	S-ORDINAL
play	O
that	O
he	O
wrote	O
that	O
made	O
him	O
famous	O
was	O
a	O
play	O
that	O
dates	O
from	O
1981	S-DATE
,	O
which	O
was	O
actually	O
called	O
`	B-WORK_OF_ART
Bus	M-WORK_OF_ART
Stop	M-WORK_OF_ART
'	E-WORK_OF_ART
,	O
which	O
many	O
people	O
said	O
or	O
had	O
resonances	O
from	O
Beckett	S-PERSON
's	O
play	O
`	O
Waiting	B-WORK_OF_ART
for	M-WORK_OF_ART
Godot	E-WORK_OF_ART
'	O
and	O
it	O
concerned	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
Chinese	S-NORP
people	O
from	O
different	O
walks	O

who	O
were	O

So	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
immediately	O
that	O
the	O
resonances	O
with	O
the	O
play	O
of	O
Beckett	S-PERSON
,	O
but	O
Gao	B-PERSON

really	O
before	O

He	O
is	O
taking	O
advantage	O
of	O
two	S-CARDINAL
crazes	O
that	O
we	O

the	O

So	O
this	O
guy	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
having	O
people	O
adopting	O
sheep	O
by	O
an	O
internet	O

So	O
you	O
can	O
have	O

on	O
your	O

Go	O
to	O
the	O

these	O

and	O
you	O

at	O
the	O

of	O
sheep	O
which	O
are	O

So	O
what	O
does	O
it	O
mean	O
to	O
adopt	O
a	O
sheep	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
up	O
on	O
your	O
back	O

or	O
do	O
you	O

somehow	O
keep	O

its	O

on	O
the	O

in	O
Italy	S-GPE
?	O

You	O
are	O
not	O
actually	O
adopting	O
the	O
sheep	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
it	O
with	O
you	O
.	O

It	O
looks	O
like	O
distant	O
adoption	O
,	O
where	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
actually	O
have	O
the	O
child	O
in	O
your	O
home	O
.	O

You	O
are	O
just	O
contributing	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
and	O
you	O
are	O
monitoring	O
the	O
growing	O
up	O
.	O

It	O
works	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
,	O
so	O
you	O
have	O
access	O
on	O
the	O
web	O
site	O
of	O
this	O
little	O
farm	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
little	O

of	O
Abrutzi	S-GPE
and	O
you	O
can	O
choose	O
among	O
many	O
,	O
many	O
sheeps	O
and	O
after	O
contributing	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
the	O
sheep	O
is	O
actually	O
yours	O
.	O

All	O
right	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
you	O
have	O
mentioned	O
to	O
us	O
is	O
about	B-MONEY
160	M-MONEY
US	M-MONEY

and	O
for	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
more	O
than	O
just	O
a	O

You	O
can	O
also	O
receive	O

that	O
are	O
made	O
from	O

of	O
the	O
sheep	O
and	O
even	O
if	O
you	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
sheep	O
dropping	O

your	O

Yeah	O
,	O
I	O

this	O
is	O
quite	O

but	O
apart	O
from	O
all	O
the	O

,	O
which	O
are	O
sometimes	O
even	O
strange	O
I	O
think	O
what	O
is	O
really	O
important	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
concern	O
that	O
is	O

Italian	S-NORP

I	O

we	O

We	O
have	O
a	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
new	O

The	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O
really	O
care	O
about	O
a	O
sheep	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
she	O

in	O
the	O

it	O

because	O
it	O

a	O

to	O

that	O
you	O

something	O

the	O

if	O
it	O

which	O

You	O

whatever	O

kind	O
of	O
puts	O
a	O

I	O
mean	O
usually	O
when	O
you	O
think	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
adoption	O
that	O
means	O
saving	O
an	O

I	O
mean	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
option	O
which	O
is	O
available	O

I	O
think	O
it	O

a	O

of	O
