What	O
we	O
know	O
about	O
Saddam	B-PERSON
Hussein	E-PERSON
in	O
recent	B-DATE
years	E-DATE
is	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
changed	O
a	O
lot	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
Islamic	S-NORP
tendecies	O
and	O
acts	O
which	O
many	O
Iraqis	S-NORP
mentioned	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
Saddam	S-PERSON
supported	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
extent	O
the	O
building	O
of	O
mosques	O
centers	O
for	O
memorizing	O
Koran	S-WORK_OF_ART
,	O
and	O
charities	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
dancer	O
's	O
punishment	O
was	O

.	O

He	O
had	O
many	O
works	O
.	O

But	O
some	O
explained	O
his	O
Islamic	S-PERSON
tendency	O
by	O
saying	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
currying	O
favor	O
with	O
the	O
Sunnis	S-NORP
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
reading	O
his	O
mind	O

I	O
have	O
followed	O
Saddam	B-PERSON
Hussein	E-PERSON
,	O
especially	O
in	O
recent	B-DATE
years	E-DATE
,	O
and	O
I	O
noticed	O
about	O
him	O
was	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
religion	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
injustice	O
and	O
coarseness	O
.	O

And	O
his	O
punishment	O
was	O
unjust	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
dancer	O
would	O
be	O
killed	O
after	O
second	S-ORDINAL
offence	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
anyone	O
to	O
kill	O
the	O
dancer	O
unless	O
good	O
would	O
come	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
like	O
the	O
most	O
idiots	O
his	O
aim	O
was	O
correct	O
but	O
the	O
method	O
was	O
wrong	O
.	O

Another	O
example	O
-	O
after	O
his	O
son	O
Udai	S-PERSON
harmed	O
the	O
Iraqi	S-NORP
people	O
and	O
attacked	O
women	O
and	O
other	O
matters	O
,	O
Saddam	S-PERSON
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
.	O

And	O
in	O
fact	O
he	O
was	O
fired	O
on	O
but	O
survived	O
miraculously	O
,	O
after	O
being	O
hit	O
with	O
several	O
fatal	O
shots	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
hit	O
his	O
spine	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
sign	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
good	O
in	O
him	O
otherwise	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
ordered	O
the	O

of	O
his	O

But	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
scholar	O

feared	O

God	O

I	O
myself	O
heard	O
from	O
some	O

about	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
Saddam	B-PERSON

could	O
not	O

anyone	O
other	O
than	O
a	O
good	O
Moslem	S-NORP
To	O
the	O
extent	O
that	O
many	O
said	O
of	O

were	O
only	O
to	O
gain	O
favor	O
amongst	O
the	O

in	O
mind	O
that	O

have	O
said	O
that	O
Saddam	S-PERSON
prayed	O

after	O

are	O
the	O

Finally	O

him	O

keep	O
him	O
from	O

his	O
death	O

They	O
were	O
trying	O
everything	O
they	O
could	O
but	O
we	O
say	O
that	O
God	O
made	O
him	O
steadfast	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
world	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
died	O
acknowledging	O

The	O

shouting	O

words	O
such	O
as	O
Muqtada	S-PERSON

al	B-PERSON

so	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
lose	O
control	O

curse	O
them	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
killed	O
him	O

So	O
they	O
could	O
show	O
the	O

there	O
is	O
cursing	O

cut	O

However	O
he	O
remained	O
steadfast	O
in	O
saying	O
the	O
creed	O
and	O
was	O
killed	O
whilst	O
saying	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
could	O
n't	O
have	O
happened	O
without	O
God	O
making	O
him	O
steadfast	O
otherwise	O
God	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
made	O
him	O
steadfast	O

Saddam	B-PERSON

that	O

it	O

he	O

I	O

that	O

are	O
probably	O

the	O

In	O
other	O

the	O

price	O
in	O
China	S-GPE
is	O
too	O
high	O
in	O

China	S-GPE

may	O
still	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Both	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Otherwise	O
,	O
If	O

,	O
it	O
would	O
make	O
Russia	O
feel	O

a	O

and	O
obstruct	O
the	O
rise	O
of	O
Russia	O

[jeffery7373]	O
A	O
weak	O
Russia	O
allows	O

which	O
will	O
undermine	O
the	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Secondly	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
strong	O
enough	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Among	O
many	O
problems	O
related	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

,	O
Mongolia	O
has	O

than	O
Taiwan	O
,	O
Diaoyu	O

and	O
South	O

.	O

[jeffery7373]	O
We	O
can	O
not	O
accept	O
Mongolia	O
because	O
of	O
its	O
voluntary	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Before	O

the	O

[jeffery7373]	O
It	O
is	O
quite	O
simple	O

If	O
the	O

we	O
can	O

the	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Thirdly	O
,	O
Mongolia	O
's	O
motivation	O
for	O

is	O
not	O
strong	O
,	O
and	O
its	O

is	O
not	O
firm	O
and	O
can	O
be	O
suspected	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
speculation	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Nowadays	O
,	O
Mongolia	O
is	O

joint	O

exercises	O
with	O
USA	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
troops	O
stationed	O
in	O
Mongolia	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
indicate	O
that	O
Mongolia	O
's	O
return	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
giant	O
alienating	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
make	O
China	O
and	O
Russia	O
suspect	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
fight	O
against	O
each	O

for	O
Mongolia	O
and	O
lose	O

and	O
trust	O

[jeffery7373]	O
Fourthly	O
,	O
for	O
China	O
and	O
Russia	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
develop	O
their	O
relations	O
with	O
Mongolia	O
jointly	O
and	O
expel	O
the	O
forces	O
of	O
USA	O
and	O
Japan	O
out	O
of	O

This	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O

Uh-huh	O

an	O
extremely	O

that	O

deeply	O

Uh-huh	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
previously	O
our	O
news	O

were	O
made	O
through	O
some	O
conventional	O
methods	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O

In	O

this	O

in	O

We	O
usually	O
make	O
it	O
sound	O
like	O
e-government	O
is	O
something	O
unattainable	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
talked	O
about	O
e-government	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
only	O
done	O
through	O
the	O
Internet	O

Right	O

It	O
seemed	O
that	O
computers	O
,	O
ah	O

and	O
the	O

,	O
ah	O
,	O
were	O
an	O
expression	O
of	O
e-government	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
people	O
find	O
out	O
information	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
presently	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
e-governments	O
in	O
various	O
countries	O
apply	O
this	O
so	O
-	O
called	O

such	O
as	O

such	O

and	O
such	O
as	O
,	O
these	O

These	O
are	O
quite	O
sophisticated	O
forms	O

Uh-huh	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
more	O
terminals	O

such	O
as	O

and	O
mobile	O

SMS	O
,	O
are	O
applied	O
in	O
e-government	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
,	O
a	O
test	O
of	O
e-government	O
because	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
during	O
SARS	O
in	O
2003	S-DATE
,	O
people	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
criticized	O
e-government	O
during	O
the	O
spread	O
of	O
SARS	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
e-government	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
put	O
into	O
use	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
short	O
SMS	O
like	O
this	O
can	O
fully	O
create	O
interaction	O
between	O
the	O
government	O
and	O
the	O
public	O
through	O
this	O
e-government	O
form	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

We	O
drive	O
often	O
in	O
Beijing	S-GPE
,	O
ha	O
,	O
Yang	B-PERSON
Yang	E-PERSON

If	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
informed	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
traffic	O
accident	O
through	O
SMS	O
on	O
that	B-DATE
day	E-DATE
and	O
they	O
continued	O
to	O
head	O
there	O
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
would	O
happen	O
if	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
and	O
the	O
jam	O
did	O
not	O
clear	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
real	O
paralysis	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
appropriate	O
word	O
to	O
use	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
when	O
SMS	O
was	O
used	O
to	O
announce	O
the	O
news	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
fit	O
the	O
conditions	O
in	O
our	O
China	S-GPE
very	O
well	O
.	O

Why	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
?	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
China	S-GPE
is	O
the	O
country	O
with	O
the	O
highest	O
SMS	O
usage	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
probably	O
not	O
as	O
many	O
chances	O
to	O
use	O
SMS	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	O
compared	O
with	O
domestically	O
,	O
in	O
China	S-GPE
,	O
ah	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
penetration	O
was	O
quite	O
high	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
by	O
using	O
the	O
most	O
familiar	O
method	O
,	O
most	O
used	O
by	O
everyone	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
prompt	O
and	O
most	O
convenient	O
method	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
announcement	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
many	O
friends	O
,	O
around	O
me	O
received	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
that	O
almost	O
everyone	O

this	O

Yes	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

The	O
effect	O
was	O
extremely	O
good	O

So	O
,	O
how	O
exactly	O
did	O
citizens	O
react	O
?	O

Let	O

Yes	O
,	O
a	O
special	O
program	O
on	O
this	O
traffic	O

So	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
first	S-ORDINAL
turn	O
our	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
impact	O
on	O
traffic	O
after	O
the	O
accident	O
.	O

Judging	O
from	O
the	O
traffic	O
control	O
measures	O
taken	O
after	O
the	O
accident	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
eventual	O
impact	O
caused	O
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
are	O
the	O
effects	O
?	O

Actually	O
,	O
concerning	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
both	O
of	O
you	O
are	O
very	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
traffic	O
in	O
Beijing	S-GPE
.	O

Previously	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
statistic	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
the	O
ring	O
roads	O
in	O
Beijing	S-GPE
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
ordinary	O
fender	O
bender	O
or	O
tailgate	O
accident	O
on	O
a	O
bridge	O
such	O
as	O
the	B-FAC
Jingguang	M-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
of	O
the	B-FAC
Third	M-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
,	O
it	O
might	O
cause	O
the	O
entire	O
Third	B-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
to	O
have	O
bumper	O
-	O
to	O
-	O
bumper	O
traffic	O
jams	O
during	O
these	O
morning	O
and	O
evening	O
peak	O
periods	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
might	O
even	O
impact	O
traffic	O
on	O
the	O
Second	B-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
and	O
Fourth	B-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
.	O

Well	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
accident	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
occurs	O
until	O
the	O
time	O
all	O
traffic	O
is	O
cleared	O
,	O
it	O
probably	O
takes	O
about	B-TIME
half	M-TIME
an	M-TIME
hour	M-TIME
to	M-TIME
an	M-TIME
hour	E-TIME
during	O
peak	O
periods	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
imposing	O
temporary	O
traffic	O
restriction	O
measures	O
on	O
a	O
long	O
section	O
of	O
road	O
stretching	O
from	O
Jingguang	B-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
to	O
Changhong	B-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
from	O
the	O
south	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
Guomao	B-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
,	O
blocking	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
side	O
roads	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
the	O
situation	O
would	O
be	O
unthinkable	O
during	O
this	O
peak	O
period	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
first	S-ORDINAL
day	O
of	O
work	O
for	O
everyone	O

Hence	O

at	O

people	O

the	O

and	O
indeed	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

Uh-huh	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
affected	O

was	O
not	O
as	O
large	O
as	O
expected	O
.	O

Moreover	O
,	O
some	O
people	O
made	O
detours	O
once	O
they	O
received	O
the	O

Right	O

Psychologically	O
,	O
people	O
felt	O

Because	O
I	O

this	O

Right	O
,	O
like	O
those	O
whom	O
we	O

just	O
now	O

It	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O

once	O
everyone	O

Yes	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
,	O
a	O

I	O

That	O

did	O

even	O

.	O

Right	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
aspect	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
citizens	O
were	O
really	O
quite	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
this	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
received	O
an	O

A	O

I	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
12th	S-ORDINAL

of	O
the	B-FAC
China	M-FAC
World	M-FAC

at	O
the	B-FAC
Guomao	M-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
,	O
ah	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
discussing	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
home	O
in	O
fewer	O
cars	O
since	O
everyone	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
route	O
.	O

Later	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
suggested	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
you	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
take	O
the	O
subway	O
,	O
because	O
you	O
can	O
directly	O
reach	O
the	O

once	O
you	O
get	O
down	O

the	B-FAC

Right	O

Hey	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
this	O
was	O
quite	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
everyone	O
was	O
quite	O
cooperative	O
and	O
also	O
quite	O
supportive	O
in	O
this	O
aspect	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
many	O
,	O
viewers	O
not	O

Beijing	S-GPE
may	O
not	O
be	O
quite	O
familiar	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
with	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
we	O
just	O
mentioned	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
accident	O
occurred	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
a	O
look	O
later	O
through	O
an	O
animation	O

This	O
road	O
represents	O
a	O
main	O
road	O
on	O
East	B-FAC
Third	M-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
,	O
with	O
problems	O
on	O
both	O
the	O
main	O
and	O

roads	O
.	O

Furthermore	O
,	O
Chaoyang	B-FAC
Road	E-FAC
is	O
an	O

Uh-huh	O

Whether	O
it	O
is	O
Chaoyang	B-FAC

in	O
the	O
east	O

west	O

or	O
the	O
main	O
and	O

of	O
East	B-FAC
Third	M-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
in	O
the	O
south	O

north	O
direction	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
from	O
this	O
diagram	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
area	O
at	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
side	O
roads	O
of	O
East	B-FAC
Third	M-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
normally	O
has	O
quite	O
heavy	O
traffic	O
,	O
especially	O
during	O
commuting	O
times	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Chaoyang	B-FAC
Road	E-FAC
is	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
artery	O
in	O
the	O
east	O
-	O
west	O
direction	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

When	O
people	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
west	O
want	O
to	O
cross	O
over	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
via	O
this	O
road	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
traffic	O
accident	O
occurs	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
indeed	O
imagine	O
,	O
ha	O
,	O
how	O
widespread	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
impact	O
will	O
be	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
cars	O
caught	O
in	O
traffic	O
jams	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
actually	O
I	O
think	O
everyone	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
buses	O
that	O
cross	O
Jingguang	B-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

As	O
buses	O
that	O
cross	O
the	B-FAC
Third	M-FAC
Ring	M-FAC
Road	E-FAC
are	O
currently	O
,	O
right	O
now	O
affected	O
by	O
the	O
Jingguang	B-FAC
Bridge	E-FAC
accident	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
the	O
latest	O
results	O
this	O
morning	O
show	O
that	O
32	S-CARDINAL
bus	O
routes	O
throughout	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
rerouted	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
perhaps	O
many	O
friends	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
are	O
wondering	O
how	O
one	S-CARDINAL
place	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
accommodate	O
32	S-CARDINAL
commuter	O
routes	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
accident	O
did	O
not	O
happen	O
,	O
perhaps	O
everyone	O
would	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
this	O

many	O
--	O

It	O
is	O
really	O

this	O

just	O
look	O
at	O
the	O

Right	O

Have	O
not	O

so	O
many	O

Right	O

Its	O

on	O

extremely	O

Many	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
because	O
social	O
management	O
requires	O
division	O
of	O

in	O

It	O
is	O
necessarily	O
a	O

that	O

in	O

Uh-huh	O

How	O
can	O

Well	O
,	O
sometimes	O
under	O

circumstances	O
,	O
sometimes	O
,	O
we	O
often	O
feel	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O

to	O
cooperate	O
with	O
one	O

For	O

there	O

very	O

in	O
the	O

they	O

at	O

there	O
was	O
none	O

this	O

of	O

It	O
was	O
not	O

it	O
was	O
very	O

You	O
sat	O
inside	O
the	O

only	O

about	O
the	O

You	O
could	O

The	O

were	O
extremely	O

Well	O
,	O
later	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
experienced	O
that	O

in	O
Beijing	O
,	O
that	O
rainfall	O
two	B-DATE

some	O

all	O

and	O
early	O

were	O
activated	O
in	O
quite	O
an	O
orderly	O
manner	O

From	O
our	O
perspective	O
as	O
media	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
precisely	O
by	O
going	O
through	O
those	O
breaking	O
-	O
in	O
,	O
trials	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
so	O
calm	O
in	O
handling	O
such	O
an	O
emergency	O
today	S-DATE
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
everyone	O
the	O
most	O
effective	O
announcements	O
and	O
notifications	O
,	O
and	O
instructions	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
local	O
media	O
in	O
this	O
city	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
become	O
a	O
proactive	O
participant	O
when	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
public	O
emergency	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

It	O
should	O
play	O
its	O
individual	O
role	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
resolving	O
emergencies	O
.	O

Ah	O
,	O
apart	O
from	O
this	O
,	O
Professor	O
Zhou	S-PERSON
,	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
are	O
the	O
areas	O
for	O
improvement	O
for	O
a	O
city	O
,	O
especially	O
a	O
booming	O
city	O
,	O
when	O
handling	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
public	O
emergency	O
?	O

Right	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
gave	O
us	O
many	O
revelations	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

First	S-ORDINAL
,	O
I	O
think	O
one	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
especially	O
important	O
is	O
early	O
warnings	O
and	O
forecasts	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
currently	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
frequently	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
risks	O
lurking	O
in	O
cities	O
,	O
ah	O
.	O

Early	O
warnings	O
and	O
forecasts	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
mechanism	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
sudden	O
road	O
cave	O
-	O
in	O
,	O
it	O
also	O
includes	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
security	O
incidents	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
society	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
natural	O
disasters	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
including	O
public	O
health	O
incidents	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
scientific	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
mechanism	O
must	O
be	O
set	O
up	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
manage	O
and	O
resolve	O
an	O
abnormal	O
situation	O
by	O
turning	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
normal	O
situation	O
,	O
without	O
evolving	O
into	O
a	O
sudden	O
public	O
emergency	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

Another	O
thing	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
besides	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
emergency	O
response	O
and	O
speedy	O
integration	O
mechanisms	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
some	O
corresponding	O
improvements	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
information	O
,	O
incident	O
investigation	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
relevant	O
post-incident	O
,	O
responsibility	O
system	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
already	O
has	O
quite	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
relevant	O
systems	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
an	O
administrative	O
investigation	O
system	O
for	O
incidents	O
of	O
major	O
responsibility	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
regulations	O
on	O
investigation	O
procedures	O
for	O
very	O
major	O
incidents	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
others	O
such	O
as	O
emergency	O
response	O
methods	O
for	O
handling	O
public	O
health	O
incidents	O
and	O
public	O
health	O
emergencies	O
,	O
among	O
others	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
many	O
corresponding	O
systems	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
how	O
city	O
management	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
handles	O
these	O
various	O
kinds	O
of	O
perhaps	O
unpredictable	O
cases	O
.	O

Since	O
we	O
are	O
entering	O
new	O
circumstances	O
of	O
human	O
living	O
,	O
circumstances	O
that	O
contain	O
high	O
risk	O
and	O
have	O
an	O
increasingly	O
developed	O
urbanized	O
life	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
corresponding	O
improvements	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
systems	O
that	O
includes	O
scientific	O
planning	O
,	O
early	O
warning	O
and	O
forecast	O
,	O
emergency	O
response	O
,	O
accident	O
investigation	O
,	O
and	O
accountability	O
.	O

Um	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
understanding	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
an	O
international	O
perspective	O
,	O
what	O
are	O
some	O
better	O
ways	O
of	O
urban	O
management	O
that	O
are	O
worthwhile	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
learn	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
,	O
in	O
comparison	O
to	O
China	S-GPE
,	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
urbanization	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	O
developed	O
earlier	O
and	O
is	O
more	O
widespread	O
.	O

Their	O
level	O
of	O
development	O
is	O
more	O
advanced	O
than	O
ours	O
.	O

Although	O
the	O
scale	O
of	O
our	O
urbanization	O
is	O
currently	O
expanding	O
at	O
a	O
rate	O
of	O
1	B-PERCENT
%	E-PERCENT
per	O
year	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
economic	O
development	O
being	O
relatively	O
backward	O
,	O
we	O
actually	O
still	O
have	O
many	O
aspects	O
of	O
urban	O
management	O
to	O
learn	O
from	O
foreign	O
countries	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
pipes	O
involved	O
in	O
this	O
incident	O
were	O
basic	O
infrastructure	O
,	O
public	O
utilities	O
industries	O
.	O

With	O
a	O
background	O
of	O
liberalization	O
,	O
marketization	O
,	O
and	O
privatization	O
,	O
how	O
can	O
the	O
government	O
strengthen	O
supervision	O
of	O
public	O
utilities	O
industries	O
?	O

How	O
can	O
a	O
safe	O
,	O
assured	O
system	O
be	O
established	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
learn	O
and	O
manage	O
this	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

For	O
instance	O
,	O
regarding	O
information	O
disclosure	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
our	O
speed	O
of	O
information	O
disclosure	O
this	O
time	O
was	O
very	O
fast	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
work	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
making	O
the	O
information	O
disclosure	O
,	O
er	O
,	O
system	O
more	O
standardized	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
to	O
really	O
implement	O
a	O
system	O
of	O
levels	O
of	O
responsibility	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
need	O
to	O
explore	O
how	O
cooperation	O
mechanisms	O
between	O
departments	O
execute	O
cooperation	O
under	O
normal	O
situations	O
and	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
how	O
departments	O
should	O
cooperate	O
with	O
one	O
another	O
under	O
these	O
kinds	O
of	O
public	O
emergency	O
circumstances	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
emergency	O
contingency	O
plans	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
how	O
will	O
these	O
emergency	O
contingency	O
plans	O
withstand	O
these	O
tests	O
?	O

We	O
know	O
that	O
currently	O
,	O
many	O
ministries	O
and	O
commissions	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
people	O
's	O
governments	O
at	O
the	O
provincial	O
level	O
,	O
along	O
with	O
those	O
at	O
municipal	O
and	O
district	O
levels	O
,	O
have	O
set	O
up	O
emergency	O
contingency	O
plans	O
for	O
public	O
emergencies	O
,	O
but	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
put	O
to	O
the	O
test	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
how	O
will	O
they	O
undergo	O
testing	O
?	O

These	O
also	O
include	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
command	O
and	O
policy	O
-	O
making	O
systems	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
growth	O
of	O
urbanization	O
and	O
with	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
of	O
such	O
complicated	O
issues	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
increasingly	O
high	O
requirements	O
on	O
the	O
systems	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
,	O
development	O
of	O
future	O
systems	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
current	O
priorities	O
.	O

How	O
can	O
we	O
institutionalize	O
our	O
response	O
mechanisms	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
into	O
a	O
system	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
ensure	O
the	O
lifestyle	O
of	O
people	O
who	O
live	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
large	O

scale	O
city	O
?	O

The	B-ORG
State	M-ORG
Council	E-ORG
has	O
proposed	O
a	O

plan	O
,	O
called	O
One	S-CARDINAL

Uh-huh	O

"	O
One	S-CARDINAL

refers	O
to	O
the	O

refers	O
to	O
systems	O
of	O

and	O

.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
work	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
these	O
three	S-CARDINAL
areas	O
of	O
organizations	O
,	O

,	O
and	O

.	O

Yes	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
finally	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
turn	O
our	O
attention	O
to	O
handling	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
latter	O
stages	O
of	O
the	O

in	O

in	O
Beijing	S-GPE

Traffic	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
directed	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
basically	O
under	O
control	O
now	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
following	O
this	O
,	O
repairs	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
on	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
where	O
the	O
accident	O
occurred	O
,	O
including	O
for	O
many	O
pipes	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Yang	B-PERSON
Yang	E-PERSON
,	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
understanding	O
,	O
how	O
long	O
will	O
it	O
take	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
really	O
depends	O
on	O
how	O
the	O
overall	O
repair	O
goes	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
exploration	O
,	O
assessment	O
,	O
and	O
repair	O
are	O
carried	O
out	O
in	O
succession	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
regarding	O
this	O
work	O
progress	O
,	O
to	O
repair	O
this	O
road	O
section	O
in	O
the	O
shortest	O
time	O
,	O
um	O
,	O
this	O
will	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
work	O
progress	O
.	O

Uh-huh	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
because	O
repair	O
is	O
probably	O
not	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
repairing	O
the	O
road	O
surface	O
alone	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
an	O
issue	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
pipes	O
below	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
the	O
pipes	O
below	O
.	O

Right	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
winter	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
that	O
carrying	O
out	O
construction	O
during	O
winter	O
,	O
especially	O
that	O
which	O
requires	O
pouring	O
concrete	O
and	O
then	O
--	O

Moreover	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
especially	O
difficult	O
for	O
concrete	O
to	O
set	O
during	O
winter	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
preparation	O
mix	O
for	O
making	O
it	O
dry	O
faster	O
,	O
has	O
already	O
been	O
added	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
it	O
requires	O
time	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
it	O
depends	O
very	O
much	O
on	O
factors	O
like	O
temperature	O
.	O

Just	O
now	O
,	O
you	O
mentioned	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
pipes	O
,	O
ah	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
key	O
heating	O
pipeline	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
is	O
to	O
ensure	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
connected	O
in	O
time	O

Yes	O
.	O

In	O
addition	O

waste	O

is	O

right	O
now	O
,	O
if	O
the	O

Yes	O

At	O

we	O

they	O

he	O

mhm	O
%um	O
you	O

It	O
feels	O

maybe	O
she	O

it	O

so	O

wow	O
wow	O

industry	O

%um	O

Terrible	O

yeah	O
it	O
's	O
amazing	O

and	O
%um	O
You	O
know	O
ages	O

I	O
got	O
a	O

from	O

I	O
told	O
you	O
this	O

because	O
%uh	O
you	O
showed	O
us	O
her	O

yeah	O

yeah	O

Crazy	O

%um	O
and	O
I	O
keep	O
thinking	O
maybe	O
I	O
'd	O
get	O
in	O
touch	O

but	O
I	O
have	O
n't	O
done	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
I	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
%um	O
Tufts	S-ORG
thing	O
that	O
Ginny	B-PERSON

you	O

yeah	O

So	O
,	O
anyway	O
,	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
doing	O
these	O
days	O
?	O

Things	O
are	O
going	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
had	O
mentioned	O
before	O
%uh	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
company	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
'm	O
working	O
with	O
%um	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
much	O
just	O
myself	O
and	O
Guss	S-PERSON
.	O

oh	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
%um	O

No	O
,	O
you	O
had	O
n't	O
mentioned	O
that	O
.	O

%eh	O
,	O
oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

okay	O
,	O
so	O
%um	O

%eh	O
you	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
leaving	O
the	O
company	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
at	O
,	O

and	O
you	O
were	O
entertaining	O
offers	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
%uh	O

well	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
sense	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
client	O
to	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
set	O
up	O
my	O
own	O
company	O
,	O
of	O
sorts	O
.	O

%um	O
oh	O
.	O
So	O
things	O
are	O
going	O
extremely	O
well	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
one	O
client	O
who	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
'd	O
pay	O
me	O
a	O
minimum	O
amount	O
.	O

You	O
know	O
,	O
he	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O

there	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
minimum	O
amount	O
of	O
work	O
,	O
of	O
about	O
%uh	O
,	O
a	O
day	O
a	O
week	O
for	O
the	B-DATE
next	M-DATE
two	M-DATE
three	M-DATE
years	E-DATE
.	O
mhm	O
.	O
Which	O
is	O
sufficient	O
to	O
pay	O
all	O
my	O
bills	O
then	O

so	O
I	O
decided	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
make	O
sense	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
.	O

%um	O
and	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
getting	O
substantially	O
more	O
work	O
than	O
then	O
.	O

%mm	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
'm	O
quite	O
pleased	O
.	O

Well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
.	O

%um	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
%uh	O
work	O
that	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
on	O
my	O
flat	O
this	B-DATE
year	E-DATE
.	O

I	O
've	O
been	O
telling	O
you	O
that	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
roof	O
atrium	O
for	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
come	O
out	O
this	B-DATE
year	E-DATE
.	O

oh	O
,	O
well	O
that	O
's	O
good	O
.	O

It	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
a	B-DATE
few	M-DATE
months	E-DATE
.	O

oh	O
,	O
yeah	O

I	O
remember	O
So	O
you	O
talking	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
about	O
it	O
at	O
one	O
point	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O

yeah	O
.	O

So	O
you	O
have	O
no	O
intentions	O
of	O
coming	O
over	O
this	O
way	O
any	O
time	O
soon	O
?	O

%um	O
.	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
the	O
finances	O
occurring	O
uh-huh	O
,	O
right	O
.	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
.	O

%um	O
,	O
actually	O
right	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O
finances	O
are	O
not	O
going	O
real	O
well	O

But	O
%ah	O
well	O
.	O
I	O
am	O
working	O
on	O
that	O
one	O
.	O

%uh	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
just	O
But	O
%um	O
%uh	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
the	O
main	O
reason	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
really	O
anticipated	O
a	O
few	O
expenses	O
that	O
recently	O
came	O
up	O
%ah	O
.	O
%uh	O
,	O
related	O
to	O
a	O

that	O
I	O
had	O

oh	O
,	O
harsh	O

Harsh	O

yeah	O

yeah	O
,	O

and	O
.	O

Not	O
a	O

I	O
can	O
do	O
about	O
that	O
now	O

Indeed	O

have	O

And	O

So	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
I	O
'm	O
doing	O
.	O

Sounds	O
good	O
.	O

But	O
%um	O
Anyway	O
,	O
%uh	O
One	S-CARDINAL
of	O
the	O
main	O
reasons	O
that	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
such	O
a	O
pathetic	O
,	O
%uh	O

has	O

I	O
've	O
actually	O
been	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

oh	O
wow	O
.	O

And	O
%uh	O
,	O
I	O
turned	O
in	O
my	O
Master	O
's	O

back	O
in	O
May	S-DATE

and	O
I	O
'm	O
actually	O
presently	O
working	O
on	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
several	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
articles	O
oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O
Impressive	O
.	O
from	O
it	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O

actually	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
that	O
one	S-CARDINAL
thing	O
,	O
one	S-CARDINAL
little	O
bit	O
in	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
turn	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
important	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
.	O
%uh	O
,	O
from	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
reading	O
in	O
the	O
literature	O
.	O

You	O
see	O
the	O
one	O
very	O
annoying	O
thing	O
about	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
was	O
my	O
advisor	O
has	O
been	O
in	O
France	S-GPE
for	O
a	B-DATE
year	M-DATE
and	M-DATE
a	M-DATE
half	E-DATE
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
made	O
writing	O
my	O
thesis	O
very	O
annoying	O
because	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
n't	O
much	O
discussion	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

yup	O
,	O

yup	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
%um	O
Anyway	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
kind	O
of	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
from	O
my	O
reading	O
of	O
the	O
literature	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
one	S-CARDINAL
little	O
alteration	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
in	O
my	O
model	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
clever	O
and	O
unique	O
.	O

mhm	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
made	O
the	O
one	S-CARDINAL
type	O
of	O
solution	O
occur	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
seen	O
experimentally	O
,	O

but	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
models	O
%uh	O
,	O
had	O
?	O

Yes	O
.	O

the-	O
,	O

I	O
'm	O
looking	O
at	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
multi	O
mode	O
lasers	O
.	O

And	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
they	O
find	O
experimentally	O
are	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
anti	O
phased	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
states	O
,	O
where	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
total	O
intensity	O
uh-huh	O
.	O
of	O
the	O
laser	O
,	O
you	O
get	O
an	O
oscillation	O
which	O
is	O
characterized	O
by	O
one	S-CARDINAL
frequency	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

if	O
you	O
separate	O
out	O
the	O
different	O
modes	O
of	O
the	O
laser	O
mhm	O
.	O
and	O
look	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
,	O
you	O
get	O
more	B-CARDINAL
than	M-CARDINAL
one	E-CARDINAL
frequency	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

So	O
what	O
's	O
happening	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
modes	O
are	O
oscillating	O
out	O
of	O
phase	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
completely	O
mask	O
each	O
other	O
's	O
Exactly	O
.	O
%hm	O
.	O
oscillations	O
on	O
these	O
other	O
frequencies	O
.	O

And	O
%uh	O
With	O
a	O
pretty	O
simple	O
model	O
you	O
can	O
find	O
that	O
frequency	O
in	O
a	O
transient	O
,	O

but	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
find	O
that	O
frequency	O
in	O
a	O
driven	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
frequency	O
.	O

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
find	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
sustain	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

So	O
yeah	O
,	O
that	O
particular	O
frequency	O
according	O
to	O
most	O
models	O
damps	O
out	O
very	O
quickly	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
you	O
should	O
n't	O
actually	O
really	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
ever	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

%hm	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
do	O
the	O
experiment	O
you	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

Got	O
it	O
,	O

got	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
see	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
simple	O
modification	O
of	O
the	O
original	O
formula	O
,	O
which	O
unfortunately	O
makes	O
the	O
solutions	O
horrendously	O
nasty	O
.	O
And	O
in	O
most	O
cases	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
insoluble	O
.	O

But	O
yeah	O
.	O
it	O
gives	O
a	O
driving	O
term	O
.	O

oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
it	O
actually	O
creates	O
a	O
situation	O
where	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
right	O
sort	O
of	O
answer	O
,	O
you	O
just	O
ca	O
n't	O
always	O
write	O
it	O
down	O
very	O
easily	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

oh	O
wow	O
.	O

so	O
you	O
're	O
pushing	O
forward	O
the	O
bounds	O
of	O
theoretical	O
laser	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
whatever	O
it	O
is	O
science	O
.	O

But	O

which	O
,	O
%um	O
,	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
considering	O
that	O
that	O
's	O
not	O
really	O
my	O
thing	O
.	O
.	O
Indeed	O
.	O
Indeed	O
.	O
being	O
an	O
experimentalist	O
,	O
not	O
a	O

.	O

%um	O
Indeed	O
.	O
oh	O
wow	O
.	O
oh	O
,	O
impressive	O
.	O
But	O

so	O
are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
article	O
in	O
Nature	S-ORG
or	O
something	O
?	O

%um	O
,	O
actually	O
,	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
we	O
're	O
shooting	O
for	O
op-	O
,	O

I	O
think	O
Optics	B-ORG
Letters	E-ORG
is	O
probably	O
the	O
one	O
that	O
we	O
're	O
shooting	O
for	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
quite	O
that	O
significant	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
Phys	B-ORG

Letters	E-ORG
.	O

%hm	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
a	B-CARDINAL
couple	E-CARDINAL
articles	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

%hm	O
.	O
impressive	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
much	O
you	O
know	O
about	O
scientific	O
literature	O
,	O

but	O
letters	O
are	O
much	O
more	O
prestigious	O
than	O
,	O
articles	O
.	O

oh	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

oh	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
realize	O
that	O
.	O

okay	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O

so	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
it	O
's	O
actually	O
a	O
big	O
deal	O
is	O

I	O
mean	O
,	O
you	O
know	O

writing	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
articles	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
Master	O
's	O
thesis	O
,	O
is	O
,	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
unusual	O
in	O
Physics	O

and	O
yeah	O
.	O
%uh	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
writing	O
a	O
letter	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
impressive	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
all	O

And	O
what	O
's	O
actually	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
is	O
I	O
kept	O
telling	O
Neil	S-PERSON
that	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
significant	O
.	O

And	O
Neil	S-PERSON
kept	O
writing	O
back	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
tone	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
thesis	O
down	O
that	O
You	O
know	O
,	O
people	O
see	O
the	O
anti	O
phased	O
motion	O
,	O

and	O
it	O
's	O
true	O

they	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
transients	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
trouble	O
getting	O
across	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
literature	O
has	O
this	O
frequency	O
in	O
the	O

Yes	O
.	O
%eh	O
and	O
not	O
driven	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
%uh	O
,	O
what	O
happened	O
was	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
turned	O
in	O
my	O

but	O
before	O
I	O
saw	O
Neil	S-PERSON
again	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
conference	O
in	O
Rochester	S-GPE
and	O
there	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
big	O
issue	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
doing	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
their	O

could	O
n't	O
show	O
this	O

this	O
up	O

Exactly	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
,	O
well	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
telling	O
you	O
that	O
Neil	S-PERSON
.	O

Indeed	O
.	O

So	O
Cool	O
.	O
Cool	O
.	O
that	O
's	O
mostly	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
stuff	O
that	O
I	O
'm	O
spending	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
on	O
now	O
.	O
%um	O

Well	O
it	O
'll	O
look	O
good	O
on	O
your	O
C	O
V	O
,	O
your	O
resume	O
.	O

so	O
you	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
spend	O
the	O
time	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
well	O
,	O

%uh	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
definitely	O
worth	O
doing	O
.	O
%um	O
,	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
spending	O
more	O
time	O
on	O
it	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
n't	O
for	O
%uh	O
dealing	O
with	O
the	O
burglary	O
issues	O
oh	O
yeah	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
dealing	O
with	O
.	O

So	O
are	O
you	O
still	O
living	O
in	O
that	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
park	O
.	O

Yes	O
.	O

yeah	O
,	O
okay	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
i-	O

this	O
place	O
is	O
incredibly	O
easy	O
to	O
break	O
into	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
.	O

oh	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
a	O
question	O
of	O
whether	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
%uh	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
easy	O
,	O

it	O
was	O
just	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
really	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
breaking	O
into	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
now	O
they	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
worth	O
breaking	O
into	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

And	O
unfortunately	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
odd	O
.	O

They	O
've	O
stolen	O
very	O
weird	O
things	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
.	O

%hm	O
.	O

as	O
far	O

yeah	O

as	O
a	O
.	O

The	O
first	S-ORDINAL
time	O
they	O
broke	O
in	O
,	O
what	O
they	O
stole	O
was	O
just	O
bizarre	O
,	O

mostly	O
worthless	O
stuff	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
%uh	O
%huh	O
the	O
most	O
worthwhile	O
thing	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
monetary	O
value	O
went	O
that	O
they	O
stole	O
was	O
the	O
pre-amplifier	O
of	O
my	O
stereo	O
.	O
Unfortunately	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
nice	O
pre-amplifier	O
,	O

it	O
has	O
an	O
off	O
board	O
power	O
supply	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
n't	O
steal	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
they	O
**stoled**	O
absolutely	O
worthless	O
.	O

%huh	O
.	O

So	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
bizarre	O
.	O
Bizarre	O
.	O

so	O
when	O
they	O
broke	O
in	O
the	O
second	S-ORDINAL
time	O
did	O
they	O
steal	O
the	O
%uh	O
offboard	O
amplifier	O
?	O

Actually	O
,	O
no	O
,	O

all	O
they	O
stole	O
the	O
second	S-ORDINAL
time	O
was	O
my	O
bike	O
.	O

%huh	O
.	O

Which	O
was	O
actually	O
where	O
the	O
major	O
problem	O
came	O
.	O
Exactly	O
.	O
Exactly	O
.	O
yeah	O
.	O
Is	O
that	O
I	O
suddenly	O
had	O
no	O
transportation	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
,	O
I	O
then	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
bike	O
hunting	O
and	O
eventually	O
get	O
another	O
bike	O
,	O

and	O
%mm	O
.	O
that	O
cost	O
me	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

Exactly	O
.	O

Because	O
,	O

yes	O

Spending	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
hunting	O
for	O
bikes	O
,	O
and	O
nah	O
well	O
.	O
then	O
getting	O
one	S-CARDINAL
purchased	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
having	O
to	O
,	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
go	O
get	O
it	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
dealt	O
with	O
at	O

.	O

And	O
so	O
%uh	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
yeah	O
at	O
least	O
dealt	O
with	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
financial	O
aspects	O
of	O
all	O
of	O
this	O

But	O
yeah	O
.	O
yeah	O
.	O

At	O

Well	O
that	O
would	O
make	O

during	O
the	O

every	B-DATE
two	M-DATE
days	E-DATE
.	O

Really	O
?	O

yeah	O
.	O

Wow	O

He	O
eats	O
at	O

like	O
four	S-CARDINAL
of	O
cereal	O
a	O
day	O
like	O
in	O

uh-huh	O

And	O
when	O
he	O

I	O

of	O
goofy	O

oh	O
my	O

Is	O
that	O
because	O
he	O
's	O
not	O

because	O
he	O

because	O
all	O
the	O

were	O
in	O

oh	O

I	O
think	O

%mm	O

and	O
the-	O

you	O
should	O

I	O
know	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
two	S-CARDINAL

I	O
'll	O
have	O
to	O
get	O

%mm	O

yeah	O

%hm	O

But	O
%uh	O
,	O
yeah	O
,	O

it	O
's	O
still	O
a	O
fairly	O
expensive	O
call	O

%uh	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
less	O
expensive	O
if	O
we	O
do	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
than	O
if	O
we	O
actually	O
make	O
my	O
parents	O
in	O
law	O
pay	O
it	O
,	O

then	O
it	O

the	O
Dutch	S-NORP
have	O
such	O
high	O
taxes	O
on	O
those	O

they	O
consider	O
it	O
a	O
luxury	O
to	O
call	O
around	O
the	O
world	O

so	O
they	O
tax	O
it	O
really	O
high	O
.	O

Anyway	O
%um	O

So	O
you	O
guys	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
either	O
the	B-DATE
eighteenth	E-DATE
or	O
the	B-DATE
nineteenth	E-DATE

and	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
%uh	O
Amsterdam	S-GPE

Well	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
is	O
once	O
you	O
're	O
at	O
a	O
hotel	O
uh-huh	O
%um	O
,	O
why	O
do	O
n't	O
you	O
call	O
me	O
at	O
work	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
where	O
you	O
are	O
,	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
can	O
make	O
arrangements	O
that	O
day	O
%um	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
meet	O
you	O
in	O
Amsterdam	S-GPE
.	O

And	O
maybe	O
I	O
'll	O
come	O
by	O
,	O
public	O
transport	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
probably	O
easier	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
by	O
public	O
transport	O
in	O
Amsterdam	S-GPE
than	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
by	O
car	O
to	O
be	O
honest	O
.	O

mhm	O
.	O

The	O
streets	O
are	O
small	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
no	O

So	O
I	O
probably	O
will	O
come	O
by	O
public	O
transport	O

but	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
.	O

We	O
'll	O
see	O
where	O
you	O
're	O
staying	O

%um	O

and	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
for	O
you	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
stuff	O

you	O
can	O
see	O
stuff	O
in	O
Amsterdam	S-GPE

and	O
%uh	O
since	O
the	O
days	O
are	O
really	O
long	O
,	O

I	O
mean	O
it	O
stays	O
light	O
here	O
till	O
about	O
ten	B-TIME
thirty	E-TIME
eleven	B-TIME
o'clock	E-TIME
mhm	O
.	O
at	B-TIME

So	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
a	O
ride	O
and	O
go	O
see	O
stuff	O
at	B-TIME

and	O
I	O
can	O
take	O
you	O
to	O
some	O
places	O
,	O

we	O
can	O
%uh	O
go	O
see	O
some	O
stuff	O
.	O

%um	O
,	O
depends	O
on	O
what	O
you	O

want	O
to	O
see	O

So	O
you	O
guys	O
should	O
pick	O
out	O
the	O
things	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
know	O

and	O
I	O
'll	O
sit	O
and	O
talk	O
with	O
Anya	S-PERSON
about	O
some	O

that	O
maybe	O
we	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
neat	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
see	O

So	O
if	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
ideas	O
we	O
'll	O
just	O
put	O
something	O

up	O
th-	O

you	O
know	O
I	O
'll	O
probably	O
be	O
there	O
some	O
time	O
around	B-TIME
six	E-TIME

and	O
we	O
can	O
like	O
do	O
a	O
quick	O
dinner	O
or	O
something	O
yeah	O
and	O
go	O
see	O
whatever	O
you	O

,	O

if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
stay	O
in	O
Amsterdam	S-GPE
that	O
's	O
fine	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
%uh	O
off	O
into	O
the	O
countryside	O
somewhere	O
and	O
see	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
,	O
echte	O
Holland	S-GPE
,	O
real	O
Holland	S-GPE
and	O
we	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
too	O
.	O

Actually	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
up	O
to	O
Holland	S-GPE
before	O
.	O

Spent	O
about	B-DATE
two	M-DATE
weeks	E-DATE
up	O
there	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

So	O
%um	O
,	O

but	O
that	O
was	O
years	B-DATE
and	M-DATE
years	M-DATE
ago	E-DATE
.	O

With	O
your	O
parents	O
when	O
your	O
father	O
was	O
stationed	O
over	O
here	O
,	O
right	O
?	O

yeah	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
see	O
Den	B-GPE
Haag	E-GPE
and	O
places	O
like	O
that	O
too	O
which	O
we	O
're	O
obviously	O
not	O
going	O
to	O

this	O

But	O
%um	O

has	O
Kim	S-PERSON
been	O
here	O
before	O
?	O

And	O
,	O
an-	O

No	O
.	O

oh	O
good	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
again	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
Kim	S-PERSON
would	O
be	O
interested	O
in	O
seeing	O
Shape	B-FAC
Headquarters	E-FAC
and	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O
.	O
those	O
military	O
things	O
.	O

Would	O
you	O
be	O
interested	O
in	O
seeing	O
Shape	B-FAC
Headquarters	E-FAC
again	O
.	O

No	O
.	O
Not	O
really	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
so	O
.	O

Somehow	O
I	O
had	O
this	O
feeling	O
that	O
the	O
military	O
taste	O
had	O
been	O
beaten	O
out	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

yep	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
,	O

the	O
mil-	O
,	O

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
say	O
too	O
bad	O
things	O
about	O
the	O
military	O
though	O
.	O

They	O
still	O
have	O
my	O
goods	O

and	O
they	O
'll	O
probably	O
hold	O
them	O
hostage	O
.	O

And	O
they	O
own	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
soul	O
for	O
like	O
another	B-DATE
four	M-DATE
years	E-DATE

so	O
I	O
just	O
got	O
to	O
pray	O
that	O
they	O

oh	O
do	O
they	O
?	O

yeah	O
.	O

I	O
owe	O
four	B-DATE
years	E-DATE
in	O
active	O
reserve	O
time	O
.	O

aw	O
great	O
.	O

Do	O
they	O
do	O
that	O
to	O
everyone	O
?	O

Milo	O
,	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
there	O

yeah	O
--	O
--	O
%eh	O
everyone	O
%uh	O
who	O
has	O
n't	O
been	O
like	O
you	O
were	O

you	O
went	O
through	O
like	O
the	O
thirty	B-CARDINAL
six	E-CARDINAL
two	S-CARDINAL
process	O
.	O

mhm	O
.	O

So	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
it	O

but	O
yeah	O
if	O
you	O
just	O
separate	O
normally	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
n't	O
served	O
at	B-DATE
least	M-DATE
eight	M-DATE
years	E-DATE
,	O
then	O
you	O
owe	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
's	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
they	O
just	O
never	O
tell	O
you	O
up	O
front	O
.	O

No	O
.	O

They	O
never	O
said	O
anything	O

I	O
figured	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
because	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
inactive	O
reserves	O
the	O
entire	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
in	O

's	O
the	O
military	O

I	O
have	O

Holland	S-GPE
and	O
I	O

they	O

that	O

if	O
you	O

Well	O
I	O

I	O
'm	O

I	O

%uh	O

if	O

and	O
I	O

here	O
I	O
probably	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
a	O
horror	O
either	O
,	O

but	O
%uh	O
yeah	O

right	O
now	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
do	O
want	O
to	O
keep	O
my	O
American	S-NORP
citizenship	O

so	O
.	O

I	O
kind	O
of	O
want	O
to	O

Are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
become	O
a	O

What	O

Are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
become	O
a	O

?	O

Have	O
dual	O
citizenship	O
?	O

You	O
ca	O
n't	O
do	O
that	O
,	O

%um	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
dual	O
citizen	O
is	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
born	O
in	O
a	O
foreign	O
country	O

like	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
born	O
in	O
Holland	S-GPE
and	O
then	O
had	O
American	S-NORP
parents	O
.	O
Then	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
a	O
dual	O
citizen	O
.	O

But	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O

If	O
I	O
would	O
to	O
ask	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
citizen	O
in	O
Holland	S-GPE
I	O
would	O
automatically	O
lose	O
my	O
American	S-NORP
citizenship	O
.	O

As	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
Americans	S-NORP
are	O
concerned	O
,	O
yeah	O
.	O

yeah	O
.	O

The	O
Dutch	S-NORP
could	O
care	O
less	O
.	O

The	O
Dutch	S-NORP
would	O
say	O
fine	O

want	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
dual	O
citizen	O
,	O

that	O
's	O
fine	O
,	O

but	O
the	O
Americans	S-NORP
as	O
soon	O
as	O
you	O
ask	O
for	O
another	O
citizenship	O
that	O
act	O
of	O
asking	O
for	O
it	O
takes	O
away	O
your	O
American	S-NORP
citizenship	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
it	O
's	O
kind	O
of	O
stupid	O
.	O

yeah	O

So	O
I	O
'm	O
an	O
expatriot	O

An	O
American	S-NORP
expatriot	O

An	O
American	S-NORP
living	O

I	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
file	O
a	O

Do	O
you	O

But	O
my	O

is	O

As	O

my	O

the	O

I	O
would	O

these	O

obviously	O

but	O
uh	O
do	O
you	O
feel	O
it	O
's	O
getting	O
the	O
attention	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
/?	O

Yeah	O
/.	O

No	O
because	O
to	O
me	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
whole	O
ballgame	O
of	O
the	O
Bush	S-PERSON
administration	O
/.	O

Katrina	S-EVENT
and	O
Rita	S-EVENT
they	O
'll	O
come	O

but	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
Bush	S-PERSON

made	O
a	O
very	O
big	O
claim	O

that	O
it	O
could	O
go	O
to	O
Iraq	S-GPE

produce	O
a	O
decent	O

there	O

If	O
that	O
happens	O
then	O
I	O
think	O
President	O

is	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
very	O

Um	O
if	O
it	O
does	O

I	O
think	O
uh	O
the	O

will	O
be	O
seen	O
as	O
a	O
complete	O

everything	O

for	O

for	O
the	O
American	S-NORP

/.	O

These	O
are	O
huge	O

so	O
I	O

n't	O

it	O
's	O
gotten	O
the	O

it	O
's	O
deserved	O

the	O

no	O

I	O

that	O

a	O

out	O

there	O
are	O
15,000	S-CARDINAL

in	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
great	O

of	O
them	O
are	O
very	O
honestly	O
managed	O
and	O
so	O
forth	O

a	O

There	O
's	O
been	O
a	O
general	O
loosening	O
of	O

What	O
I	O
was	O
referring	O
to	O
in	O
that	O

you	O
had	O
was	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
cases	O

out	O
at	O
the	O

where	O

Is	O
the	O

today	S-DATE
in	O
your	O
judgment	O

?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
marketplace	O
is	O
becoming	O
increasingly	O
secure	O

I	O
think	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
reforms	O
that	O
have	O
come	O
via	O
the	B-LAW
Sarbanes	M-LAW

Oxley	M-LAW

and	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
done	O
at	O
the	O
SEC	S-ORG
are	O
basically	O
making	O
everybody	O
take	O
a	O
new	O
look	O
at	O
how	O
they	O
're	O
performing	O
their	O

and	O
in	O
Wall	B-ORG

I	O
think	O
the	O
reforms	O
that	O
came	O
as	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
settlement	O
are	O
going	O

And	O
some	O
people	O
are	O
surprised	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
even	O
add	O
pleased	O
in	O
this	O
city	O
that	O
your	O
SEC	S-ORG
has	O
been	O
quick	O
to	O
react	O
when	O
Phil	B-PERSON
Purcell	E-PERSON
of	O
Morgan	B-ORG
Stanley	E-ORG
made	O
a	O

that	O
your	O
SEC	S-ORG

n't	O

and	O
that	O
you	O
did	O
n't	O
think	O
expressed	O
appropriate	O
contrition	O
when	O
Bear	B-ORG
Stearns	E-ORG
stepped	O
out	O
of	O

in	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
SEC	S-ORG

It	O
was	O
n't	O
a	O
polite	O
phone	O

quietly	O
made	O

either	O
from	O
your	O

from	O
your	O

it	O
was	O
rather	O
public	O

Is	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
operate	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
Lou	S-PERSON
,	O
we	O
're	O
deadly	O

about	O

We	O
're	O
deadly	O
serious	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

we	O

and	O
when	O
we	O

it	O

we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
them	O
right	O

And	O
I	O
think	O
perhaps	O
no	O
one	O
more	O
surprised	O
than	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
running	O
those	O

on	O

You	O
have	O
also	O

about	O

Is	O
there	O
really	O
anything	O
that	O

be	O
done	O
about	O
this	O

I	O
think	O
so	O
,	O
Lou	S-PERSON

I	O
think	O
the	O
real	O
next	O
step	O
here	O
is	O
for	O
compensation	O
committees	O
to	O
spend	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
time	O
than	O
they	O
do	O
on	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
really	O
compensating	O
for	O

I	O
think	O
there	O
's	O
been	O
too	O
much	O
emphasis	O
on	O
performance	O
defined	O
strictly	O
by	O
stock	O

I	O
think	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
other	O
measures	O
that	O
indicate	O
how	O
well	O
somebody	O
's	O
doing	O
running	O
a	O
company	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
corporation	O

need	O
to	O
spend	O
more	O
time	O
on	O
that	O
dimension	O

Christy	B-PERSON

that	O

the	O

did	O

quite	O
a	O
misfit	O
for	O
this	O

and	O
she	O
showed	O
that	O
over	O

over	O

She	O
was	O
not	O

at	O
all	O
at	O

the	O

to	O

she	O
was	O
even	O
worse	O
at	O

bureaucracy	O

the	O
EPA	S-ORG
environmental	O
policy	O
makers	O
'	O
message	O
to	O
this	O

because	O
she	O
saw	O
herself	O

over	O

over	O

That	O
's	O
interesting	O

New	B-GPE

herself	O

an	O

and	O
then	O
only	O
to	O

up	O

we	O
really	O

the	O

we	O

far	O
better	O
off	O
working	O
within	O
the	O
framework	O
of	O
the	O

because	O
you	O
get	O

I	O
simply	O
do	O

it	O

So	O
the	O
problem	O
here	O
is	O
not	O
the	O

Jesus	O

the	O

In	O

Saul	O
was	O
still	O
trying	O
to	O
scare	O
the	O
followers	O
of	O
the	O
Lord	O
,	O
even	O
saying	O
he	O
would	O

He	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
high	O

asked	O
him	O
to	O
write	O
letters	O
to	O
the	O

the	O
city	O

Saul	O
wanted	O
the	O
high	O
priest	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
authority	O
to	O
find	O
people	O
in	O
Damascus	O
who	O

If	O
he	O

he	O
would	O
arrest	O

them	O

So	O
Saul	O
went	O
to	O
Damascus	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
a	O
very	O

from	O

suddenly	O
shined	O
around	O
him	O

He	O
fell	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
heard	O
a	O
voice	O
saying	O
to	O
him	O

``	O

The	O
men	O
traveling	O
with	O
Saul	O
just	O
stood	O
there	O
,	O
unable	O

They	O
heard	O
the	O
voice	O

they	O

Saul	O
got	O
up	O
from	O

opened	O
his	O

he	O
could	O

So	O
the	O
men	O
with	O
him	O
held	O
his	O

led	O
him	O
into	O
Damascus	O

For	O
three	O

Saul	O
could	O

he	O
did	O
not	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
follower	O
of	O
Jesus	O
in	O
Damascus	O
named	O
Ananias	O

In	O
a	O
vision	O
the	O
Lord	O
said	O
to	O
him	O

``	O

Ananias	O
answered	O
,	O
``	O
Here	O

The	O
Lord	O
said	O

``	O

He	O
is	O
there	O

He	O
has	O

a	O

him	O
so	O
that	O

But	O
Ananias	O
answered	O

``	O

me	O
about	O
the	O

things	O
he	O

people	O

Now	O
he	O
has	O
come	O
here	O
to	O
Damascus	O

The	O
leading	O

But	O
the	O

``	O

So	O
Ananias	O
left	O

went	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Judas	O

He	O
laid	O
his	O

Immediately	O
,	O
something	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
fish	O

fell	O
off	O
Saul	O
's	O
eyes	O

He	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
see	O

Then	O
he	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
was	O
baptized	O

After	O
he	O
ate	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O
strong	O
again	O

Saul	O
stayed	O
with	O
the	O
followers	O
of	O
Jesus	O
in	O
Damascus	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
.	O

Soon	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
synagogues	O
and	O
tell	O
people	O
about	O
Jesus	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
``	O
Jesus	O

the	O
Son	O
of	O
God	O
!	O
''	O

All	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
heard	O
Saul	O
were	O
amazed	O

They	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
Jerusalem	O
trying	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
trust	O
in	O
Jesus	O

And	O
that	O
's	O
why	O
he	O
has	O
come	O
here	O
--	O
to	O
arrest	O

Jesus	O
and	O
take	O
them	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
leading	O
priests	O
.	O
''	O

But	O
Saul	O
became	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
powerful	O
in	O
proving	O
that	O
Jesus	O
is	O
the	O
Christ	O
.	O

His	O
proofs	O
were	O
so	O
strong	O
that	O
the	O
Jews	O
who	O
lived	O
in	O
Damascus	O
could	O
not	O
argue	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

After	O
many	O
days	O
,	O
some	O
Jews	O
made	O
plans	O
to	O
kill	O
Saul	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
watching	O
the	O
city	O
gates	O
day	O
and	O
night	O
.	O

They	O
wanted	O
to	O
kill	O
Saul	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
learned	O
about	O
their	O
plan	O
.	O

One	O
night	O
some	O
followers	O
that	O
Saul	O
had	O
taught	O
helped	O
him	O
leave	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

They	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
basket	O
and	O
lowered	O
it	O
down	O
through	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
wall	O
.	O

Then	O
Saul	O
went	O
to	O
Jerusalem	O
.	O

He	O
tried	O
to	O
join	O
the	O
group	O
of	O
followers	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
afraid	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
really	O
a	O
follower	O
of	O
Jesus	O
.	O

But	O
Barnabas	O
accepted	O
Saul	O
and	O
took	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
apostles	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
how	O
Saul	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
Lord	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
and	O
how	O
the	O
Lord	O
had	O
spoken	O
to	O
Saul	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
how	O
boldly	O
Saul	O
had	O
spoken	O
for	O
the	O
Lord	O
in	O
Damascus	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
Saul	O
stayed	O
with	O
the	O
followers	O
and	O
went	O
all	O
around	O
Jerusalem	O
speaking	O
boldly	O
for	O
the	O
Lord	O
.	O

He	O
often	O
had	O
arguments	O
with	O
the	O
Greek	O
-	O
speaking	O
Jews	O
,	O
who	O
began	O
making	O
plans	O
to	O
kill	O
him	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
believers	O
learned	O
about	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
Saul	O
to	O
Caesarea	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
there	O
they	O
sent	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Tarsus	O
.	O

The	O
church	O
in	O
Judea	O
,	O
Galilee	O
,	O
and	O
Samaria	O
had	O
a	O
time	O
of	O
peace	O
.	O

With	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
Holy	O
Spirit	O
,	O
the	O
groups	O
of	O
believers	O
became	O
stronger	O
and	O
showed	O
their	O
respect	O
for	O
the	O
Lord	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
lived	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
church	O
everywhere	O
grew	O
in	O
numbers	O
.	O

Peter	O
was	O
traveling	O
through	O
all	O
the	O
areas	O
around	O
Jerusalem	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
stopped	O
to	O
visit	O
the	O
believers	O

in	O
Lydda	O

There	O
he	O
met	O
a	O
man	O

was	O

He	O
stood	O
up	O
immediately	O

All	O
the	O
people	O
living	O
in	O
Lydda	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
plain	O
of	O
Sharon	O
saw	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
decided	O
to	O
follow	O
the	O
Lord	O

In	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Joppa	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
follower	O
of	O

named	O
Tabitha	O

Her	O
Greek	O
name	O

Dorcas	O

doing	O
good	O

giving	O
money	O
to	O
those	O

While	O
Peter	O
was	O
in	O
Lydda	O
,	O
Tabitha	O
became	O
sick	O
and	O
died	O
.	O

They	O
washed	O
her	O
body	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
an	O
upstairs	O
room	O

The	O
followers	O
in	O
Joppa	O
heard	O
that	O
Peter	O
was	O
in	O
Lydda	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
far	O
away	O

So	O
they	O
sent	O
two	O

who	O
begged	O
him	O
,	O
``	O

Peter	O

When	O
he	O

they	O
took	O
him	O
to	O
the	O

All	O
the	O

Peter	O
sent	O
all	O
the	O

out	O

He	O
knelt	O
down	O

he	O
turned	O

different	O
languages	O
and	O
prophesying	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
about	O
twelve	O
men	O
in	O
this	O
group	O
.	O

Paul	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
synagogue	O
and	O
spoke	O
very	O
boldly	O
.	O

He	O
continued	O
doing	O
this	O
for	O
three	O
months	O
.	O

He	O
talked	O
with	O
the	O
Jews	O
,	O
trying	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
accept	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
telling	O
them	O
about	O
God	O
's	O
kingdom	O
.	O

But	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
became	O
stubborn	O
and	O
refused	O
to	O
believe	O
.	O

In	O
front	O
of	O
everyone	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
bad	O
things	O
about	O
the	O
Way	O
.	O

So	O
Paul	O
left	O
these	O
Jews	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
Lord	O
's	O
followers	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
a	O
man	O
named	O
Tyrannus	O
had	O
a	O
school	O
.	O

There	O
Paul	O
talked	O
with	O
people	O
every	O
day	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
this	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
.	O

Because	O
of	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
everyone	O
in	O
Asia	O
,	O
Jews	O
and	O
Greeks	O
,	O
heard	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
the	O
Lord	O
.	O

God	O
used	O
Paul	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
very	O
special	O
miracles	O
.	O

Some	O
people	O
carried	O
away	O
handkerchiefs	O
and	O
clothes	O
that	O
Paul	O
had	O
used	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
sick	O
.	O

The	O
sick	O
people	O
were	O
healed	O
,	O
and	O
evil	O
spirits	O
left	O
them	O
.	O

Some	O
Jews	O
also	O
were	O
traveling	O
around	O
forcing	O
evil	O
spirits	O
out	O
of	O
people	O
.	O

The	O
seven	O
sons	O
of	O
Sceva	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
leading	O
priests	O
,	O
were	O
doing	O
this	O
.	O

These	O
Jews	O
tried	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
Lord	O
Jesus	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
evil	O
spirits	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
people	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
By	O
the	O
same	O
Jesus	O
that	O
Paul	O
talks	O
about	O
,	O
I	O
order	O

come	O
out	O
!	O
''	O

But	O
one	O
time	O
an	O
evil	O
spirit	O
said	O
to	O
these	O
Jews	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
know	O
Jesus	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
know	O
about	O

?	O
''	O

Then	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
evil	O
spirit	O
inside	O
him	O
jumped	O
on	O
these	O
Jews	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
much	O
stronger	O
than	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
beat	O
them	O
up	O
and	O
tore	O
their	O
clothes	O
off	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
from	O
that	O
house	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
Ephesus	O
,	O
Jews	O
and	O
Greeks	O
,	O
learned	O
about	O
this	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
all	O
filled	O
with	O
fear	O
and	O
gave	O
great	O
honor	O
to	O
the	O
Lord	O
Jesus	O
.	O

Many	O
of	O
the	O
believers	O
began	O
to	O
confess	O
,	O
telling	O
about	O
all	O
the	O
evil	O
things	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
used	O
magic	O
.	O

These	O
believers	O
brought	O
their	O
magic	O
books	O
and	O
burned	O
them	O
before	O
everyone	O
.	O

These	O
books	O
were	O
worth	O
about	O
50	O
,	O
000	O
silver	O
coins	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
how	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
the	O
Lord	O
was	O
spreading	O
in	O
a	O
powerful	O
way	O
,	O
causing	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
people	O
to	O
believe	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
Paul	O
made	O
plans	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Jerusalem	O
.	O

He	O
planned	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
regions	O
of	O
Macedonia	O
and	O
Achaia	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
go	O
to	O
Jerusalem	O

He	O
thought	O
,	O
``	O
After	O
I	O
visit	O
Jerusalem	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
also	O
visit	O
Rome	O

''	O

Timothy	O
and	O
Erastus	O
were	O
two	O
of	O
his	O
helpers	O
.	O

Paul	O
sent	O
them	O
ahead	O
to	O
Macedonia	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
stayed	O
in	O
Asia	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
.	O

But	O
during	O
that	O
time	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
trouble	O
in	O
Ephesus	O
about	O
the	O
Way	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
how	O
it	O
all	O
happened	O
:	O
There	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
named	O
Demetrius	O
.	O

He	O
worked	O
with	O
silver	O
.	O

He	O
made	O
little	O
silver	O
models	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
the	O
goddess	O
Artemis	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
who	O
did	O
this	O
work	O
made	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money	O
.	O

Demetrius	O
had	O
a	O
meeting	O
with	O
these	O
men	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
who	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
of	O
work	O

He	O
told	O
them	O

``	O

that	O

But	O
look	O
at	O
what	O
this	O
man	O
Paul	O
is	O
doing	O

Listen	O
to	O
what	O
he	O
is	O
saying	O

He	O
has	O
convinced	O
many	O
people	O
in	O
Ephesus	O
and	O
all	O
over	O
Asia	O
to	O
change	O
their	O
religion	O
.	O

He	O
says	O
the	O

are	O
not	O

I	O
'm	O
afraid	O

is	O
going	O
to	O
turn	O
people	O
against	O
our	O
business	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
also	O
another	O
problem	O
.	O

People	O
will	O
begin	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
temple	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
goddess	O
Artemis	O
is	O
not	O
important	O
.	O

Her	O
greatness	O
will	O
be	O
destroyed	O
.	O

And	O
Artemis	O
is	O
the	O
goddess	O
that	O
everyone	O
in	O
Asia	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
world	O
worships	O
.	O
''	O

When	O
the	O
men	O
heard	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
became	O
very	O
angry	O

They	O
shouted	O
,	O
``	O

the	O

The	O
whole	O
city	O
was	O
thrown	O
into	O
confusion	O

The	O
people	O
grabbed	O
Gaius	O
and	O
Aristarchus	O

men	O
from	O
Macedonia	O
who	O
were	O
traveling	O
with	O
Paul	O
,	O
and	O
rushed	O
all	O
together	O
into	O
the	O

Paul	O

but	O
the	O
Lord	O

did	O
not	O

Also	O
,	O
some	O
leaders	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
who	O
were	O
friends	O
of	O
Paul	O
sent	O
him	O
a	O
message	O
telling	O
him	O

Some	O
people	O
were	O
shouting	O
one	O
thing	O
and	O
others	O
were	O
shouting	O
something	O
else	O

The	O
meeting	O
was	O
very	O
confused	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
why	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
there	O

Some	O
Jews	O
made	O
a	O
man	O
named	O
Alexander	O
stand	O
before	O
the	O
crowd	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
to	O

Alexander	O
waved	O
his	O
hand	O

when	O

Then	O
the	O

is	O
what	O
God	O
said	O
in	O
that	O
promise	O

``	O
About	O
this	O

that	O

Rebecca	O

they	O
had	O
the	O

before	O
the	O
two	O

were	O

,	O
God	O
told	O
Rebecca	O
,	O
``	O
The	O
older	O

will	O
serve	O
the	O
younger	O

''	O

This	O
was	O
before	O
the	O
boys	O
had	O
done	O
anything	O
good	O
or	O
bad	O
.	O

God	O
said	O
this	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
born	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
boy	O
he	O
wanted	O
would	O
be	O
chosen	O
because	O
of	O
God	O
's	O
own	O
plan	O

He	O
was	O
chosen	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
one	O
God	O
wanted	O
to	O
call	O
,	O
not	O
because	O
of	O
anything	O
the	O
boys	O
did	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
Scriptures	O
say	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
loved	O
Jacob	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
hated	O
Esau	O

''	O

So	O
what	O
does	O
this	O
mean	O
?	O

That	O
God	O
is	O
not	O
fair	O
?	O

We	O
can	O
not	O
say	O
that	O
.	O

God	O
said	O
to	O
Moses	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
will	O
show	O
mercy	O

I	O
will	O
show	O
pity	O

So	O
God	O
will	O
choose	O
anyone	O
he	O
decides	O
to	O
show	O
mercy	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
choice	O
does	O
not	O
depend	O
on	O
what	O
people	O
want	O
or	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
Scriptures	O
God	O
says	O
to	O
Pharaoh	O
:	O
``	O
I	O

I	O
wanted	O
my	O

So	O
God	O
shows	O

to	O
those	O

mercy	O
to	O

makes	O

those	O

It	O
is	O
the	O

with	O
what	O
God	O
has	O
done	O

He	O
wanted	O
to	O
show	O
his	O

to	O

So	O
what	O
does	O
all	O
this	O

It	O
means	O
that	O

this	O

the	O

I	O
give	O
them	O

have	O
the	O

the	O

must	O

our	O

No	O

God	O

says	O
the	O

it	O

was	O

The	O
one	O

that	O
is	O

too	O
much	O

Others	O
have	O
this	O

to	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
trying	O

anything	O

you	O

That	O
is	O
not	O
my	O
purpose	O
for	O
writing	O
this	O

I	O
would	O
rather	O
die	O
than	O
to	O
have	O
someone	O
take	O
away	O
what	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
source	O
of	O
pride	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
not	O
my	O
work	O
of	O
telling	O
the	O

I	O

only	O
doing	O
the	O
duty	O

what	O

run	O

do	O
this	O

n't	O
miss	O

the	O

myself	O
after	O
telling	O

it	O

I	O
really	O
do	O

We	O
will	O
be	O
ashamed	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
sure	O
of	O
you	O

And	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
ashamed	O
too	O
!	O

So	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
ask	O
these	O
brothers	O
to	O
come	O
there	O
before	O
we	O
do	O
.	O

They	O
will	O
help	O
in	O
getting	O
together	O
the	O
generous	O
gift	O
you	O
promised	O
.	O

Then	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
ready	O
when	O
we	O
come	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
seen	O
as	O
a	O
blessing	O
you	O
are	O
giving	O
,	O
not	O
as	O
something	O
you	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
do	O

Remember	O
this	O
:	O
The	O
one	O
who	O
plants	O
few	O
seeds	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
small	O
harvest	O

But	O
the	O
one	O
who	O
plants	O
a	O
lot	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
big	O
harvest	O

Each	O
one	O
of	O
you	O
should	O
give	O
what	O
you	O
have	O
decided	O
in	O
your	O
heart	O
to	O
give	O
.	O

You	O
should	O
not	O
give	O
if	O
it	O
makes	O
you	O
unhappy	O
or	O
if	O
you	O
feel	O
forced	O
to	O
give	O
.	O

God	O
loves	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
happy	O
to	O
give	O

And	O
God	O
can	O
give	O
you	O
more	O
blessings	O
than	O
you	O
need	O
,	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
always	O
have	O
plenty	O
of	O
everything	O

You	O
will	O
have	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
to	O
every	O
good	O

As	O
the	O
Scriptures	O
say	O

``	O
He	O

God	O

God	O

The	O
first	O

had	O
rules	O
for	O
worship	O
and	O
a	O

for	O

here	O
on	O

This	O

was	O
inside	O

The	O

the	O

called	O
the	O

In	O
the	O

were	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
special	O

Behind	O
the	O

was	O
a	O
room	O
called	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O

In	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O

was	O
a	O
golden	O
altar	O
for	O
burning	O

And	O
also	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
Box	O
of	O
the	O
Agreement	O
.	O

The	O
Box	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
gold	O

Inside	O
this	O
Box	O
was	O
a	O
golden	O
jar	O
of	O

and	O
Aaron	O
's	O

--	O
the	O
rod	O
that	O

Also	O
in	O
the	O
Box	O
were	O
the	O
flat	O

with	O
the	O
Ten	O
Commandments	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
agreement	O
on	O
them	O

Above	O
the	O
Box	O
were	O
the	O
Cherub	O
angels	O
that	O
showed	O
God	O

glory	O

These	O
Cherub	O
angels	O
were	O
over	O
the	O

of	O
mercy	O

But	O
we	O
can	O
not	O
say	O
everything	O
about	O
this	O
now	O
.	O

Everything	O
in	O
the	O
tent	O
was	O
made	O
ready	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
have	O
explained	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
priests	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
first	O
room	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
worship	O
duties	O
.	O

But	O
only	O
the	O
high	O
priest	O
could	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
second	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
went	O
in	O
only	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
never	O
enter	O
that	O
room	O
without	O
taking	O
blood	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
offered	O
that	O
blood	O
to	O
God	O
for	O
himself	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
sins	O
the	O
people	O
committed	O
without	O
knowing	O
they	O
were	O
sinning	O
.	O

The	O
Holy	O
Spirit	O
uses	O
those	O
two	O
separate	O
rooms	O
to	O
teach	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O
was	O
not	O
open	O
while	O
the	O
first	O
room	O
was	O
still	O
there	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
example	O
for	O
us	O
today	O
.	O

It	O
shows	O
that	O
the	O
gifts	O
and	O
sacrifices	O
the	O
priests	O
offer	O
to	O
God	O
are	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
consciences	O
of	O
the	O
worshipers	O
completely	O
clear	O
.	O

These	O
gifts	O
and	O
sacrifices	O
are	O
only	O
about	O
food	O
and	O
drink	O
and	O
special	O
washings	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
only	O
rules	O
about	O
the	O
body	O

God	O
gave	O
them	O
for	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
follow	O
until	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
his	O
new	O
way	O
.	O

But	O
Christ	O
has	O
already	O
come	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
high	O
priest	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
the	O
high	O
priest	O
of	O
the	O
good	O
things	O
we	O
now	O
have	O
.	O

But	O
Christ	O
does	O
not	O
serve	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
like	O
the	O
tent	O
that	O
those	O
other	O
priests	O
served	O
in	O
.	O

He	O
serves	O
in	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
.	O

Unlike	O
that	O
tent	O
,	O
this	O
one	O
is	O
perfect	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
made	O
by	O
anyone	O
here	O
on	O
earth	O
.	O

It	O
does	O
not	O
belong	O
to	O
this	O
world	O
.	O

Christ	O
entered	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O
only	O
one	O
time	O
--	O
enough	O
for	O
all	O
time	O
.	O

He	O
entered	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O
by	O
using	O
his	O
own	O
blood	O
,	O
not	O
the	O
blood	O
of	O
goats	O
or	O
young	O
bulls	O
.	O

He	O
entered	O
there	O
and	O
made	O
us	O
free	O
from	O
sin	O
forever	O
.	O

The	O
blood	O
of	O
goats	O
and	O
bulls	O
and	O
the	O
ashes	O
of	O
a	O
cow	O
were	O
sprinkled	O
on	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
no	O
longer	O
pure	O
enough	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
worship	O
.	O

The	O
blood	O
and	O
ashes	O
made	O
them	O
pure	O
again	O
--	O
but	O
only	O
their	O
bodies	O
.	O

So	O
surely	O
the	O
blood	O
sacrifice	O
of	O
Christ	O
can	O
do	O
much	O
more	O
.	O

Christ	O
offered	O
himself	O
through	O
the	O
eternal	O
Spirit	O
as	O
a	O
perfect	O
sacrifice	O
to	O
God	O
.	O

His	O
blood	O
will	O
make	O
us	O
completely	O
clean	O
from	O
the	O
evil	O
we	O
have	O
done	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
give	O
us	O
clear	O
consciences	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
worship	O
the	O
living	O
God	O
.	O

So	O
Christ	O
brings	O
a	O
new	O
agreement	O
from	O
God	O
to	O
his	O
people	O
.	O

He	O
brings	O
this	O
agreement	O
so	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
chosen	O
by	O
God	O
can	O
have	O
the	O
blessings	O
God	O
promised	O
,	O
blessings	O
that	O
last	O
forever	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
happen	O
only	O
because	O
Christ	O
died	O
to	O
free	O
people	O
from	O
sins	O
committed	O
against	O
the	O
commands	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
agreement	O
.	O

When	O
someone	O
dies	O
and	O
leaves	O
a	O
will	O
,	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
proof	O
that	O
the	O
one	O
who	O
wrote	O
the	O
will	O
is	O
dead	O
.	O

A	O
will	O
means	O
nothing	O
while	O
the	O
one	O
who	O
wrote	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
living	O
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
used	O
only	O
after	O
that	O
person	O
's	O
death	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
why	O
blood	O
was	O
needed	O
to	O
begin	O
the	O
first	O
agreement	O
between	O
God	O
and	O
his	O
people	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
Moses	O
told	O
the	O
people	O
every	O
command	O
in	O
the	O
law	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
blood	O
of	O
young	O
bulls	O
and	O
mixed	O
it	O
with	O
water	O
.	O

He	O
used	O
red	O
wool	O
and	O
a	O
branch	O
of	O
hyssop	O
to	O
sprinkle	O
the	O
blood	O
and	O
water	O
on	O
the	O
book	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
and	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
This	O
is	O
the	O
blood	O
that	O
makes	O
the	O
agreement	O
good	O

the	O

God	O
commanded	O
you	O
to	O

''	O

In	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
,	O
Moses	O
sprinkled	O
the	O
blood	O
on	O
the	O
Holy	O
Tent	O
.	O

He	O
sprinkled	O
the	O
blood	O
over	O
everything	O
used	O
in	O
worship	O
.	O

The	O
law	O
says	O
that	O
almost	O
everything	O
must	O
be	O
made	O
clean	O
by	O
blood	O
.	O

Sins	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
forgiven	O
without	O
a	O
blood	O
sacrifice	O

These	O
things	O
are	O
copies	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
in	O
heaven	O
.	O

These	O
copies	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
clean	O
by	O
animal	O
sacrifices	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
real	O
things	O
in	O
heaven	O
must	O
have	O
much	O
better	O
sacrifices	O
.	O

Christ	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
man	O
-	O
made	O
one	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
only	O
a	O
copy	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
one	O

He	O
went	O
into	O
heaven	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
is	O
there	O
now	O
before	O
God	O
to	O
help	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
high	O
priest	O
enters	O
the	O
Most	O
Holy	O
Place	O
once	O
every	O
year	O
.	O

He	O
takes	O
with	O
him	O
blood	O
to	O
offer	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
offer	O
his	O
own	O
blood	O
like	O
Christ	O
did	O
.	O

Christ	O
went	O
into	O
heaven	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
offer	O
himself	O
many	O
times	O
like	O
the	O
high	O
priest	O
offers	O
blood	O
again	O
and	O
again	O
.	O

If	O
Christ	O
had	O
offered	O
himself	O
many	O
times	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
needed	O
to	O
suffer	O
many	O
times	O
since	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
world	O
was	O
made	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
offer	O
himself	O
only	O
once	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
once	O
is	O
enough	O
for	O
all	O
time	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
the	O
world	O
is	O
nearing	O
an	O
end	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
to	O
take	O
away	O
all	O
sin	O
by	O
offering	O
himself	O
as	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
.	O

Everyone	O
must	O
die	O
once	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
are	O
judged	O
.	O

So	O
Christ	O
was	O
offered	O
as	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
one	O
time	O
to	O
take	O
away	O
the	O
sins	O
of	O
many	O
people	O

And	O
he	O
will	O
come	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
offer	O
himself	O
for	O
sin	O

He	O
will	O
come	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
to	O
bring	O
salvation	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
waiting	O
for	O
him	O

The	O
fifth	O
angel	O
blew	O
his	O
trumpet	O

Then	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
star	O
fall	O
from	O
the	O
sky	O
to	O
the	O
earth	O

The	O
star	O
was	O
given	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
deep	O
hole	O
that	O
leads	O
down	O
to	O
the	O

Then	O
the	O
star	O
opened	O
the	O
hole	O
leading	O
to	O
the	O
pit	O

Smoke	O
came	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
hole	O

smoke	O
from	O
a	O
big	O
furnace	O

The	O
sun	O
and	O

became	O
dark	O

of	O
the	O
smoke	O
from	O

Then	O
locusts	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
smoke	O

went	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
earth	O

They	O
were	O
given	O
the	O
power	O

Jezebel	O
sent	O

``	O

When	O
Elijah	O
heard	O
this	O

he	O
was	O
afraid	O

So	O
he	O
ran	O
away	O
to	O
save	O
his	O

He	O
took	O

servant	O
with	O
him	O

walked	O

Then	O
he	O
sat	O
down	O
under	O
a	O

asked	O
to	O
die	O

He	O
said	O

``	O

Then	O
Elijah	O
lay	O
down	O
under	O
the	O

went	O
to	O

An	O
angel	O
came	O

him	O

The	O

said	O

``	O

Elijah	O
looked	O
around	O

by	O
his	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

the	O

So	O
Elijah	O
got	O
up	O

He	O
ate	O
and	O
drank	O
and	O
felt	O
strong	O

Then	O
Elijah	O
walked	O

40	O
days	O

the	O

When	O

Let	O

If	O
we	O
actually	O
use	O
120	B-CARDINAL

as	O
the	O
statistic	O
for	O
the	O

It	O

in	O

should	O
be	O
around	O

Of	O

we	O

the	O

summit	O

Cairo	S-GPE

Financial	M-ORG

.	O

James	S-PERSON
,	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
Arabs	S-NORP
wanted	O
this	O
pre-summit	O
meeting	O
.	O

What	O
is	O
the	O
pressure	O
on	O
them	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
summit	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
want	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
iron	O
out	O
any	O
potential	O
difficulties	O
before	O
the	O
heads	O
of	O
state	O
come	O
into	O
town	O
on	O
Saturday	S-DATE
and	O
Sunday	S-DATE
.	O

So	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
preparatory	O
exercise	O
to	O
reach	O
some	O
sort	O
of	O
agreement	O
beforehand	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
not	O
all	O
Arab	S-NORP
states	O
are	O
speaking	O
again	O
with	O
one	S-CARDINAL
voice	O
.	O

What	O
do	O
they	O
hope	O
to	O
achieve	O
?	O
and	O
what	O
can	O
you	O
claim	O
from	O
the	O
statements	O
made	O
today	S-DATE
?	O

It	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
Arab	S-NORP
's	O
summit	O
have	O
traditionally	O
been	O
exercises	O
in	O
division	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
already	O
seen	O
problems	O
from	O
Libyan	S-NORP
leader	O
Muammar	B-PERSON
Gaddafi	E-PERSON
on	O
Tuesday	S-DATE
who	O
appeared	O
on	O
Al	B-ORG
-	M-ORG

,	O
the	O
pan-Arab	S-NORP
satellite	O
channel	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
rubbish	O
,	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
a	O
draft	O
statement	O
for	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
summit	O
on	O
Sunday	S-DATE
.	O

And	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
categorical	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
weak	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
harm	O
Israeli	S-NORP
interests	O
sufficiently	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
have	O
Gadafi	S-PERSON
on	O
the	O
one	S-CARDINAL
hand	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
we	O
have	O
Egypt	S-GPE
which	O
was	O
the	O
first	S-ORDINAL
Arab	S-NORP
country	O
to	O
make	O
peace	O
with	O
the	O
Jewish	S-NORP
state	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
of	O
course	O
also	O
a	O
top	O
recipient	O
of	O
US	S-GPE
aid	O
.	O

The	O
Egyptian	S-NORP
President	O
Hosni	B-PERSON
Mubarak	E-PERSON
is	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
voice	O
of	O
moderation	O
against	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
.	O

Tell	O
us	O
about	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
saying	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Mubarak	S-PERSON
has	O
been	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
voice	O
of	O
moderation	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
invested	O
an	O
awful	O
amount	O
in	O
the	O
peace	O
with	O
Israel	S-GPE
,	O
and	O
really	O
he	O
can	O
not	O
afford	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
fail	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
seen	O
some	O
more	O
power	O
techniques	O
perhaps	O
from	O
his	O
Foreign	O
Minister	O
Amre	B-PERSON
Moussa	E-PERSON
over	O
the	B-DATE
last	M-DATE
few	M-DATE
weeks	E-DATE
,	O
but	O
Amre	B-PERSON
Moussa	E-PERSON
today	S-DATE
at	O
the	O
Foreign	O
Minister	O
's	O
meeting	O
was	O
calling	O
simply	O
for	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
East	B-GPE
Jerusalem	E-GPE
to	O
the	O
Palestinians	S-NORP
,	O
in	O
stark	O
contrast	O
to	O
Syrian	S-NORP
Foreign	O
Minister	O
Faruq	B-PERSON
al	M-PERSON
-	M-PERSON
Shara	E-PERSON
who	O
was	O
pulling	O
for	O
a	O
complete	O
cut	O
in	O
diplomatic	O
relations	O
between	O
Israel	S-GPE
and	O
the	O
two	S-CARDINAL
Arab	S-NORP
states	O
that	O
happen	O
.	O

So	O
Egypt	S-GPE
is	O
playing	O
a	O
calming	O
role	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
anything	O
too	O
strong	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
summit	O
due	O
to	O
end	O
on	O
Sunday	S-DATE

What	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
prevailing	O
voices	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
?	O

There	O
are	O
certainly	O
calls	O
for	O
war	O
against	O
Israel	S-GPE
.	O

Is	O
there	O
much	O
support	O
for	O
that	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
actually	O
President	O
Mubarak	S-PERSON
was	O
very	O
categorical	O
today	S-DATE
in	O
condemning	O
calls	O
for	O
war	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
were	O
very	O
serious	O
and	O
people	O
should	O
understand	O
the	O
implications	O
of	O
just	O
what	O
it	O
meant	O
.	O

Egypt	S-GPE
and	O
Jordan	S-GPE
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
conventional	O
war	O
against	O
Israel	S-GPE
.	O

They	O
have	O
both	O
invested	O
enormous	O
amounts	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
regimes	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
vulnerable	O
if	O
the	O
peace	O
process	O
were	O
to	O
fail	O
,	O
because	O
detractors	O
and	O
opponents	O
within	O
each	O
country	O
would	O
have	O
ammunition	O
by	O
which	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

How	O
much	O
is	O
the	B-GPE
United	M-GPE
States	E-GPE
entering	O
into	O
the	O
conversation	O
and	O
how	O
much	O
pressure	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
from	O
the	B-GPE
United	M-GPE
States	E-GPE
?	O

Well	O
today	O
not	O
too	O
much	O
.	O

I	O
mean	O
Madeleine	B-PERSON
Albright	E-PERSON
was	O
in	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	E-GPE
yesterday	S-DATE
where	O
she	O
met	O
with	O

and	O
the	O
new	O
Syrian	S-NORP
President	O
Bashar	B-PERSON
Al	M-PERSON

Interestingly	O
enough	O
she	O
is	O
quoted	O
as	O
telling	O
General	O
Sanholi	S-PERSON
back	O
to	O
the	O
US	S-GPE
that	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
really	O
get	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
reception	O
from	O
Bashar	B-PERSON
Al	M-PERSON
-	M-PERSON
Assad	E-PERSON
in	O
terms	O
of	O
lightening	O
the	O
traditionally	O

Israel	S-GPE
.	O

Nonetheless	O
,	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
she	O
did	O
meet	O
with	O
Bashar	B-PERSON
Al	M-PERSON

Assad	E-PERSON
and	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
is	O
significant	O

So	O

as	O

today	S-DATE

I	O
would	O

about	O
the	O

He	O
said	O
exactly	O
what	O
the	O
Indians	S-NORP
wanted	O
to	O
hear	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
dispute	O
over	O
Kashmir	S-GPE
between	O
India	S-GPE

should	O

that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
no	O

as	O
he	O

in	O

Now	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
the	O
Indians	O
have	O
been	O

all	O
along	O

Of	O

,	O
Pakistan	S-GPE
wants	O
international	O
attention	O
focussed	O
on	O
Kashmir	S-GPE
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Putin	S-PERSON
also	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
supports	O
India	S-GPE
's	O
tough	O
approach	O
to	O
the	O
external	O
violence	O
in	O
Kashmir	S-GPE
as	O
he	O
described	O
it	O

This	O
is	O
another	O

that	O
the	O
Indians	S-NORP
were	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
him	O
say	O

and	O
he	O
also	O
said	O
that	O
both	O
India	S-GPE

Russia	S-GPE
suffer	O
from	O
the	O

sort	O
of	O
terrorism	O

as	O
he	O

that	O
